## **🧬 Power Analysis**

### **📖 Introduction**

**Power Analysis** is a fundamental concept in study design and statistical inference. It answers:

✅ **What is the probability that my study will detect a true effect, if it exists?**

---

### **🔍 What is Power?**

**Power (1–β)** is the probability of **correctly rejecting the null hypothesis** when it is false (i.e. detecting a true effect).

✅ **High power (≥80%)** reduces the risk of **Type II error (false negative).**

---

### **📝 Key Components**

1. **Effect Size (Δ or Cohen’s d, OR, RR):**

   * The **minimum effect** considered clinically meaningful.
2. **Sample Size (n):**

   * Number of observations or participants in the study.
3. **Significance Level (α):**

   * Probability of **Type I error (false positive)**, commonly 0.05.
4. **Power (1–β):**

   * Desired probability of detecting the effect, commonly **80% or 90%**.

---

### **💡 Types of Power Analysis**

✅ **A Priori Power Analysis (Sample Size Calculation):**

* Calculate **required sample size** given effect size, α, and desired power.

✅ **Post Hoc Power Analysis:**

* Calculate **achieved power** given sample size, effect size, and α (not recommended for interpreting non-significant results).

✅ **Sensitivity Analysis:**

* Determine **minimum detectable effect size** given n, α, and power.

✅ **Criterion Analysis:**

* Determine **α required** to achieve a specified power with given n and effect size.

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A researcher plans a two-group comparison:

* **Expected effect size (Cohen’s d):** 0.50 (medium)
* **Sample size per group:** 50
* **Alpha (α):** 0.05

✅ What is the **power** of this study?

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels.stats.power module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

from statsmodels.stats.power import TTestIndPower

# Define parameters
effect_size = 0.50  # medium
n = 50
alpha = 0.05

# Create analysis object
analysis = TTestIndPower()

# Calculate power
power = analysis.power(effect_size=effect_size, nobs1=n, alpha=alpha, ratio=1, alternative='two-sided')

print(f"Achieved Power: {power:.2%}")
```

✅ **Output:** Achieved Power: \~70%

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Power = 70%:** Study has a **70% chance of detecting an effect size of 0.50** with 50 participants per group at 5% significance level.

---

### **💡 Improving Power**

1. **Increase sample size (n)**
2. **Increase effect size (Δ)** by using more sensitive measurements
3. **Increase α (Type I error)** – not recommended in clinical research
4. **Reduce variability (σ)** with better study design or measurements

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Power analysis requires **reasonable estimates of effect size and variability**
❌ **Post hoc power analysis is not recommended** to justify non-significant results; confidence intervals are more informative

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Power analysis ensures studies are adequately designed to detect meaningful effects**
✅ Depends on **effect size, sample size, alpha, and desired power**
✅ Essential for **ethical approval, grant applications, and robust research conclusions**
