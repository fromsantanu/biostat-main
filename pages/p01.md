## **üß¨ Clinical and Epidemiological Techniques ‚Äì Introduction**

### **üìñ Overview**

Clinical and epidemiological research forms the backbone of **evidence-based medicine** and **public health decision-making**. To analyse data arising from these fields, biostatisticians employ a set of specialised techniques that extend beyond general statistical tests.

These methods are essential to:

* Measure **disease burden** in populations
* Compare **risks between groups**
* Analyse **survival and time-to-event data**
* Understand **associations and causations** in observational studies

### **üîç Why These Techniques Matter**

In clinical trials, we often study:

* **Effectiveness of a new treatment** (e.g. cancer survival rates)
* **Time until an event occurs** (e.g. relapse or death)
* **Comparisons of disease risk** between exposed and unexposed groups

In epidemiology, the focus is on:

* **Disease occurrence** (incidence, prevalence)
* **Identifying risk factors** (relative risk, odds ratio)
* **Evaluating public health interventions**

### **üìë What You Will Learn in This Section**

This chapter introduces you to **key clinical and epidemiological analysis techniques**, including:

1. **Survival Analysis**

   * *Kaplan-Meier Estimator*
   * *Log-Rank Test*
   * *Cox Proportional Hazards Model*

2. **Life Tables**

3. **Incidence and Prevalence Calculations**

4. **Relative Risk (RR) and Odds Ratio (OR)**

5. **Hazard Ratios**

Each technique will be explored in **separate chapters**, where you will learn:

* The **conceptual meaning** and purpose
* **When to use** each technique
* **Step-by-step calculations**
* **Python or R implementations** with example datasets
* **Interpretation of results** in practical scenarios

### **üéØ Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
‚úÖ Understand the purpose and application of each technique
‚úÖ Choose the **appropriate method** for analysing clinical and epidemiological data
‚úÖ Perform these analyses using **statistical software**
‚úÖ Interpret the results to make **meaningful clinical or public health conclusions**
