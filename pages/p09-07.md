## **🧬 Stochastic and Agent-Based Modelling (Overview)**

### **📖 Introduction**

While deterministic models (e.g. SIR, SEIR) use **fixed equations**, real-world disease spread involves **random events and individual variability**. **Stochastic and agent-based models** address these complexities.

---

### **🔍 What is Stochastic Modelling?**

✅ **Stochastic models** incorporate **randomness** in disease transmission and progression.

* Useful for **small populations** where chance events impact outcomes
* Represented using **probability distributions** for transitions between compartments

---

#### **Example: Stochastic SIR Model**

* Instead of fixed infection rates, probability of a susceptible becoming infected depends on:

✅ Number of infectious individuals
✅ Transmission probability per contact

---

### **💡 Applications**

✅ Modelling **outbreaks in small communities or hospitals**
✅ Estimating **extinction probabilities** (chance outbreak dies out)
✅ Evaluating **uncertainty in epidemic projections**

---

### **📝 What is Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)?**

✅ **Agent-Based Models** simulate **individuals (agents)** with defined characteristics and behaviours interacting within an environment.

* Each agent can have **unique attributes** (e.g. age, location, immunity status)
* Interactions drive **emergent population-level outcomes**

---

### **💡 Applications of ABM**

✅ Modelling complex interventions:

* **School closures, travel restrictions, targeted vaccination**

✅ Simulating **heterogeneous populations** with:

* Spatial structure (households, workplaces)
* Behavioural differences (compliance, mobility)

✅ Widely used in **COVID-19 policy modelling**.

---

### **🔬 Practical Example of ABM Workflow**

1. **Define agents**

* Attributes (e.g. age, health status)
* States (S, E, I, R)

2. **Define environment**

* Spatial layout (e.g. city, network)

3. **Define rules of interaction**

* Contact rates, movement, transmission probability

4. **Run simulations**

* Track outcomes (e.g. infection counts, intervention impacts)

---

### **🖥️ Tools for Stochastic and ABM**

✅ **Python packages**

* **SimPy:** General-purpose discrete-event simulation
* **Mesa:** Agent-based modelling framework

✅ **R packages**

* **EpiModel:** Network-based and stochastic epidemic models

✅ **Specialised software**

* **NetLogo:** Widely used ABM platform with visual interface

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ **Computationally intensive** for large populations
❌ Requires detailed **parameterisation and validation**

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Stochastic models** incorporate randomness, essential for small populations or early outbreaks
✅ **Agent-Based Models** simulate individual behaviours and interactions, capturing **heterogeneity and complex dynamics**
✅ Widely used in **policy evaluation, outbreak simulations, and preparedness planning**
