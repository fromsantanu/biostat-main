## **🧬 Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review Statistics – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

In modern clinical research and evidence-based medicine, decisions are not based on **single studies alone**. Instead, researchers:

✅ **Synthesize results from multiple studies**
✅ Assess **overall effectiveness or associations**
✅ Evaluate **consistency, heterogeneity, and publication bias**

This is achieved through **Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses**.

---

### **🔍 What is a Systematic Review?**

A **Systematic Review** is a rigorous method to:

✅ Identify, appraise, and synthesise **all relevant studies** on a specific question
✅ Follow **predefined protocols** to minimise bias

---

### **🔍 What is Meta-Analysis?**

**Meta-Analysis** is a statistical technique used to:

✅ Combine quantitative results from multiple studies
✅ Calculate an **overall pooled estimate** (e.g. effect size, odds ratio)
✅ Assess **heterogeneity** among study results

---

### **📝 Why are They Important?**

✅ Increase **statistical power** by combining small studies
✅ Provide **more precise estimates** of effects
✅ Identify **consistency or variability** across different settings
✅ Essential for **clinical guidelines and public health policies**

---

### **📑 What You Will Learn in This Section**

This chapter introduces **key statistical techniques in Meta-Analysis**, including:

1. **Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis**
2. **Random Effects Meta-Analysis**
3. **Forest Plots**
4. **Funnel Plots and Publication Bias**

---

### **💡 Applications**

✅ Evaluating **treatment efficacy across multiple trials**
✅ Summarising **risk factors** across epidemiological studies
✅ Informing **systematic reviews, Cochrane reviews, and guideline development**

---

### **🎯 Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

✅ Understand the **principles of systematic reviews and meta-analysis**
✅ Perform **basic meta-analysis calculations**
✅ Interpret **forest plots and funnel plots**
✅ Assess **heterogeneity and publication bias**
✅ Apply these skills using **Python or R examples**
