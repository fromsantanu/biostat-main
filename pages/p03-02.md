## **🧬 Linear Mixed Effects Models**

### **📖 Introduction**

In real-world clinical and epidemiological studies, repeated measures data often have complexities such as:

✅ **Missing data points**
✅ **Unequal time intervals** between measurements
✅ **Nested data structures** (e.g. patients within hospitals)

**Linear Mixed Effects Models (LMM)** address these issues effectively.

---

### **🔍 What are Linear Mixed Effects Models?**

**Linear Mixed Effects Models** (also called **Multilevel or Hierarchical Linear Models**) are an extension of linear regression that:

✅ Include both **fixed effects** (overall population parameters) and **random effects** (subject-specific variations)
✅ Account for **correlations within subjects** due to repeated measurements

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Fixed Effects**

* Coefficients that apply **to the entire population**
* E.g. effect of time or treatment

#### **2. Random Effects**

* Account for **individual variability** (intercepts and/or slopes)
* E.g. each patient has their own baseline BP

---

#### **Model Structure**

$$
Y_{ij}
= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{ij} + u_i + \epsilon_{ij}
$$

Where:

* $\beta_0$ = fixed intercept
* $\beta_1$ = fixed slope (effect of predictor)
* $u_i$ = random effect for subject *i*
* $\epsilon_{ij}$ = residual error

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ **Repeated measures data** with potential missing values
✅ **Nested data structures** (e.g. patients within clinics)
✅ **Random subject-specific intercepts or slopes**

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

Using the previous **BP dataset** with three time points per patient, we model:

* **Fixed effect:** Time (to assess BP change over time)
* **Random effect:** Patient-specific intercepts (each has unique baseline BP)

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels mixed linear model**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import mixedlm

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'patient': list(range(1,11))*3,
    'time': ['baseline']*10 + ['week2']*10 + ['week4']*10,
    'bp': [140,150,160,145,155,150,148,152,160,158,
           135,148,158,140,150,148,145,150,155,153,
           130,145,155,135,145,142,140,145,150,150]
})

# Encode time as numeric for trend analysis
data['time_num'] = data['time'].map({'baseline':0, 'week2':1, 'week4':2})

# Fit Linear Mixed Effects Model
model = mixedlm("bp ~ time_num", data, groups=data["patient"])
result = model.fit()

print(result.summary())
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* **Fixed effect coefficient (time\_num):** Average change in BP per time unit
* **Random effect (Intercept Var):** Variability of baseline BP across patients
* **p-value < 0.05 (fixed effect):** Time has significant effect on BP

---

### **💡 Advantages over Repeated Measures ANOVA**

✅ Handles **missing data and unbalanced designs**
✅ Models **random slopes and intercepts**
✅ Accommodates **unequal time intervals**

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Linear Mixed Effects Models** are powerful for **longitudinal and hierarchical data**
✅ Account for **within-subject correlations and between-subject variability**
✅ Widely used in **clinical trials, growth studies, and multi-level health data analysis**
