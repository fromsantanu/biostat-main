## **🧬 Genetic and Epidemiological Modelling (Advanced) – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

Modern biostatistics increasingly includes **advanced genetic analysis** and **epidemiological modelling** to:

✅ Understand **disease transmission dynamics**
✅ Identify **genetic determinants** of diseases
✅ Predict **population-level impacts of interventions**

This chapter introduces advanced modelling techniques essential for **public health researchers, genetic epidemiologists, and biostatisticians** working in **infectious diseases and genomics**.

---

### **🔍 What are Genetic and Epidemiological Modelling Techniques?**

#### **1. Genetic Modelling**

✅ Analyses the **inheritance patterns of genes** and their association with diseases.

Includes:

* Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
* Linkage and Association Analysis
* Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
* Heritability Estimation

---

#### **2. Epidemiological Modelling**

✅ Uses **mathematical models** to describe and predict **disease spread in populations**.

Includes:

* Compartmental models (SIR, SEIR)
* Basic Reproduction Number (R₀) estimation
* Stochastic models and simulations
* Agent-based models

---

### **📝 Why are They Important?**

✅ **Genetic modelling** helps identify **risk genes**, enabling precision medicine.
✅ **Epidemiological modelling** guides **public health decisions**, such as vaccination strategies and outbreak control.

---

### **💡 Applications**

* **COVID-19 spread prediction** using SEIR models
* **Malaria intervention impact modelling**
* **GWAS studies** for complex traits like diabetes or hypertension
* **Estimating heritability** of mental health disorders

---

### **🎯 Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

✅ Understand **core concepts in genetic modelling**
✅ Apply **basic epidemiological models (SIR, SEIR)**
✅ Calculate and interpret **R₀ and model parameters**
✅ Implement simplified genetic and epidemiological models using **Python or R**
