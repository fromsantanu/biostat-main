## **üß¨ Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)**

### **üìñ Introduction**

In longitudinal or repeated measures studies, outcomes are not always continuous and normally distributed. For example:

* **Binary outcomes:** Success / Failure, Disease / No disease
* **Count outcomes:** Number of hospital visits

To model such **correlated non-normal outcomes**, **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)** are used.

---

### **üîç What are Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)?**

**GEE** is an extension of generalized linear models (GLM) that:

‚úÖ Account for **correlated observations** within clusters (e.g. repeated measures within subjects)
‚úÖ Provide **population-averaged (marginal) estimates** rather than subject-specific estimates
‚úÖ Handle **non-normal outcome distributions** (binary, count, etc.)

---

### **üìù Key Concepts**

#### **1. Correlation Structure**

GEE requires specifying the **working correlation structure** within clusters:

* **Independent:** No correlation (rare in repeated data)
* **Exchangeable:** Same correlation for all pairs within a cluster
* **Autoregressive:** Correlation decreases with time distance
* **Unstructured:** Each pair has its own correlation

‚úÖ GEE estimates remain **consistent even if correlation structure is mis-specified**, though efficiency may reduce.

#### **2. Marginal vs Subject-Specific Models**

|           | **GEE**                        | **Mixed Effects Model**      |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Estimates | **Population-averaged** effect | Subject-specific effect      |
| Best for  | **Public health and policy**   | Individual-level predictions |

---

### **üí° When to Use**

‚úÖ **Correlated data** with non-normal outcomes
‚úÖ Interest in **average population effect** rather than individual differences
‚úÖ Outcomes are **binary, count, or other GLM families**

---

### **üî¨ Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A study examines whether **smoking status** affects the **probability of having a cough** over **3 time points** in **10 patients**.

| **Patient** | **Time** | **Smoking (1=Yes)** | **Cough (1=Yes)** |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1           | Baseline | 1                   | 1                 |
| 1           | Week 2   | 1                   | 1                 |
| 1           | Week 4   | 1                   | 0                 |
| ...         | ...      | ...                 | ...               |

*(Data continues similarly for all patients)*

### **üñ•Ô∏è Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels GEE function**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.genmod.generalized_estimating_equations import GEE
from statsmodels.genmod import families
from statsmodels.genmod.cov_struct import Exchangeable

# Example dummy data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'patient': [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3],
    'time': ['baseline','week2','week4']*3,
    'smoking': [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1],
    'cough': [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]
})

# Encode time as numeric if needed
data['time_num'] = data['time'].map({'baseline':0, 'week2':1, 'week4':2})

# Fit GEE model with exchangeable correlation structure
model = sm.GEE.from_formula("cough ~ smoking + time_num",
                            groups="patient",
                            data=data,
                            family=families.Binomial(),
                            cov_struct=Exchangeable())
result = model.fit()

print(result.summary())
```

---

### **üîë Interpretation**

* **Coefficient for smoking:** Effect on log odds of cough
* **exp(coef):** Odds Ratio (OR) for smoking status
* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant association between smoking and cough occurrence

---

### **üí° Advantages of GEE**

‚úÖ Models **various outcome types (binary, count, continuous)**
‚úÖ Adjusts for **correlation within subjects**
‚úÖ Provides **robust standard errors**

---

### **üéØ Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **GEE** is ideal for analysing **correlated, non-normal outcomes** in repeated measures or clustered data
‚úÖ Provides **population-averaged estimates** for public health policy and interventions
‚úÖ Complements **mixed effects models**, focusing on **marginal rather than subject-specific effects**
