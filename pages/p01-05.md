## **üß¨ Incidence and Prevalence Calculations**

### **üìñ Introduction**

In epidemiology and public health, two fundamental measures describe **disease occurrence in populations**:

‚úÖ **Incidence** ‚Äì Measures **new cases** occurring over a period
‚úÖ **Prevalence** ‚Äì Measures **existing cases** at a point or period

Understanding these is crucial for:

* Planning healthcare services
* Identifying public health priorities
* Designing and interpreting research studies

### **üîç What is Incidence?**

**Incidence** refers to the **number of new cases** of a disease that develop in a specific population during a specified time period.

#### **Types of Incidence**

1. **Incidence Proportion (Cumulative Incidence)**

$$
\text{Incidence Proportion} = \frac{\text{Number of new cases during time period}}{\text{Population at risk at the beginning of the period}}
$$

‚úÖ Interpreted as **risk** of developing disease over the time period.

---

2. **Incidence Rate (Incidence Density)**

$$
\text{Incidence Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of new cases}}{\text{Total person-time at risk}}
$$

‚úÖ Takes into account **time each individual was at risk**.

---

### **üîç What is Prevalence?**

**Prevalence** refers to the **total number of cases (both new and existing)** of a disease in a population at a given time.

#### **Types of Prevalence**

1. **Point Prevalence**

$$
\text{Point Prevalence} = \frac{\text{Number of existing cases at a specific point in time}}{\text{Population at that time}}
$$

2. **Period Prevalence**

$$
\text{Period Prevalence} = \frac{\text{Number of existing cases during a period}}{\text{Average population during that period}}
$$

‚úÖ Indicates **burden of disease** in the community.

### **üí° Key Differences**

| **Measure**    | **What it measures**       | **Focus**                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Incidence**  | New cases                  | **Risk** or **rate of occurrence** |
| **Prevalence** | All cases (new + existing) | **Burden** of disease              |

### **üî¨ Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

In a town of **10,000 people**, a study found:

* **50 new cases** of tuberculosis (TB) in 2024.
* At the start of 2024, **100 people already had TB**.
* **Population remained stable** throughout the year.

---

#### **Calculations**

1. **Incidence Proportion (Cumulative Incidence)**

$$
= \frac{50}{10,000 - 100}
= \frac{50}{9,900}
= 0.00505 \text{ or } 0.505\%
$$

‚úÖ *Approximately 0.5% of the at-risk population developed TB in 2024.*

---

2. **Point Prevalence at end of 2024**

Total existing cases = previous cases + new cases

$$
= 100 + 50
= 150
$$

$$
\text{Point Prevalence} = \frac{150}{10,000}
= 0.015 \text{ or } 1.5\%
$$

‚úÖ *At the end of 2024, 1.5% of the population had TB.*

---

### **üñ•Ô∏è Implementation in Python**

Here is a simple **calculation code**:

```python
# Data
population = 10000
existing_cases_start = 100
new_cases = 50

# Incidence Proportion
at_risk_population = population - existing_cases_start
incidence_proportion = new_cases / at_risk_population

# Point Prevalence (end of year)
total_cases_end = existing_cases_start + new_cases
point_prevalence = total_cases_end / population

# Print results
print(f"Incidence Proportion: {incidence_proportion:.3%}")
print(f"Point Prevalence: {point_prevalence:.3%}")
```

---

### **üîë Interpretation**

* **Incidence proportion** tells us **risk** of contracting the disease in the period.
* **Prevalence** tells us **how widespread** the disease is at a given time.

---

### **üéØ Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **Incidence** and **Prevalence** are core measures in epidemiology.
‚úÖ Incidence measures **risk of developing disease**, while prevalence measures **burden of disease**.
‚úÖ Both are crucial for **public health planning and research design**.
