## **🧬 Random Effects Meta-Analysis**

### **📖 Introduction**

Unlike the **Fixed Effect model**, which assumes a **common true effect size across all studies**, the **Random Effects model**:

✅ Assumes that **true effect sizes vary between studies**
✅ Accounts for both **within-study variance** and **between-study variance (heterogeneity)**

---

### **🔍 What is Random Effects Meta-Analysis?**

**Random Effects Meta-Analysis**:

✅ Provides an **average effect estimate**, assuming studies are a random sample from a distribution of true effects
✅ More conservative (wider confidence intervals) than fixed effect, as it incorporates **between-study heterogeneity**

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Between-Study Variance (τ²)**

Estimated heterogeneity variance, usually using **DerSimonian and Laird method**:

$$
\tau^2 = \frac{Q - (k - 1)}{C}
$$

Where:

* **Q** = heterogeneity statistic
* **k** = number of studies
* **C** = sum of weights minus sum of squared weights divided by sum of weights

If **Q < (k - 1)**, τ² is set to **zero**.

---

#### **2. Weighting**

Each study is weighted by:

$$
w_i^* = \frac{1}{SE_i^2 + \tau^2}
$$

---

#### **3. Pooled Effect Estimate**

$$
\hat{\theta}_{RE}
= \frac{\sum w_i^* \theta_i}{\sum w_i^*}
$$

---

#### **4. Variance and 95% Confidence Interval**

$$
Var(\hat{\theta}_{RE}) = \frac{1}{\sum w_i^*}
$$

$$
SE = \sqrt{Var}
$$

$$
CI = \hat{\theta}_{RE} \pm 1.96 \times SE
$$

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Studies are **heterogeneous** (true effect varies)
✅ Aim is to generalise results beyond included studies

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

Using the **same dataset as Chapter 4.2**:

| **Study** | **Effect Estimate (RR)** | **Standard Error (SE)** |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1         | 0.80                     | 0.10                    |
| 2         | 0.85                     | 0.12                    |
| 3         | 0.78                     | 0.15                    |
| 4         | 0.82                     | 0.09                    |
| 5         | 0.88                     | 0.11                    |

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Calculate fixed effect weights (w\_i)**

| Study | SE   | w\_i   |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 1     | 0.10 | 100.0  |
| 2     | 0.12 | 69.44  |
| 3     | 0.15 | 44.44  |
| 4     | 0.09 | 123.46 |
| 5     | 0.11 | 82.64  |

---

2. **Calculate Q (heterogeneity statistic)**

$$
Q = \sum w_i (\theta_i - \hat{\theta}_{FE})^2
$$

Using **pooled effect from fixed effect = 0.827 (from previous chapter)**:

$$
Q = (100*(0.80-0.827)^2)
+ (69.44*(0.85-0.827)^2)
+ (44.44*(0.78-0.827)^2)
+ (123.46*(0.82-0.827)^2)
+ (82.64*(0.88-0.827)^2)
$$

$$
Q = 0.073 + 0.037 + 0.097 + 0.006 + 0.281 = 0.494
$$

---

3. **Calculate τ²**

$$
df = k - 1 = 4
$$

$$
C = \sum w_i - \frac{\sum w_i^2}{\sum w_i}
$$

First calculate sums:

* $\sum w_i = 420$
* $\sum w_i^2 = 10000 + 4822 + 1975 + 15241 + 6830 = 28868$

Then:

$$
C = 420 - \frac{28868}{420}
= 420 - 68.73
= 351.27
$$

Finally:

$$
\tau^2 = \frac{Q - df}{C}
= \frac{0.494 - 4}{351.27}
$$

Since **Q < df**, set **τ² = 0**.

✅ Thus, **no significant between-study heterogeneity**. Random Effects model reduces to Fixed Effect in this case.

---

*(For illustration, let’s assume τ² = 0.01 to show calculations with heterogeneity)*

---

4. **Calculate Random Effects Weights**

$$
w_i^* = \frac{1}{SE_i^2 + \tau^2}
$$

| Study | SE²    | τ²   | SE² + τ² | w\_i^\* |
| ----- | ------ | ---- | -------- | ------- |
| 1     | 0.01   | 0.01 | 0.02     | 50.0    |
| 2     | 0.0144 | 0.01 | 0.0244   | 40.98   |
| 3     | 0.0225 | 0.01 | 0.0325   | 30.77   |
| 4     | 0.0081 | 0.01 | 0.0181   | 55.25   |
| 5     | 0.0121 | 0.01 | 0.0221   | 45.25   |

---

5. **Calculate pooled random effect**

$$
\hat{\theta}_{RE}
= \frac{\sum w_i^* \theta_i}{\sum w_i^*}
$$

$$
= \frac{(50*0.80)+(40.98*0.85)+(30.77*0.78)+(55.25*0.82)+(45.25*0.88)}{222.25}
$$

$$
= \frac{40+34.83+24+45.30+39.82}{222.25}
$$

$$
= \frac{183}{222.25}
= 0.823
$$

---

6. **Calculate SE and 95% CI**

$$
Var = \frac{1}{222.25}
= 0.0045
$$

$$
SE = 0.067
$$

$$
CI = 0.823 \pm 1.96 * 0.067
= (0.692, 0.954)
$$

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels meta-analysis module (if installed) or manual calculation**:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'study': [1,2,3,4,5],
    'RR': [0.80,0.85,0.78,0.82,0.88],
    'SE': [0.10,0.12,0.15,0.09,0.11]
})

# Fixed effect weights
data['weight_FE'] = 1 / data['SE']**2

# Calculate pooled fixed effect
pooled_FE = (data['RR'] * data['weight_FE']).sum() / data['weight_FE'].sum()

# Calculate Q
data['diff_sq'] = (data['RR'] - pooled_FE)**2
data['Q_comp'] = data['weight_FE'] * data['diff_sq']
Q = data['Q_comp'].sum()

# Between-study variance (tau^2)
k = len(data)
df = k - 1
sum_w = data['weight_FE'].sum()
sum_w_sq = (data['weight_FE']**2).sum()
C = sum_w - (sum_w_sq / sum_w)

tau2 = max(0, (Q - df) / C)

# Random effects weights
data['weight_RE'] = 1 / (data['SE']**2 + tau2)

# Pooled random effect
pooled_RE = (data['RR'] * data['weight_RE']).sum() / data['weight_RE'].sum()

# Variance, SE, CI
var_RE = 1 / data['weight_RE'].sum()
SE_RE = np.sqrt(var_RE)
CI_lower = pooled_RE - 1.96 * SE_RE
CI_upper = pooled_RE + 1.96 * SE_RE

print(f"Random Effects Pooled RR: {pooled_RE:.3f}")
print(f"95% CI: ({CI_lower:.3f}, {CI_upper:.3f})")
print(f"Tau^2 (Between-study variance): {tau2:.4f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Pooled RR = 0.823 (95% CI: 0.692, 0.954)**
✅ Suggests treatment reduces risk by \~17%, accounting for between-study variability.
✅ **τ² > 0** indicates heterogeneity.

---

### **💡 Advantages**

✅ Accounts for **both within- and between-study variability**
✅ More realistic in presence of **heterogeneity**

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Random Effects Meta-Analysis** is essential when studies estimate **different true effects**
✅ Provides **conservative pooled estimates** with wider CIs
✅ Commonly used in **clinical guidelines and evidence synthesis**
