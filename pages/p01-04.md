## **🧬 Chapter 1.5: Life Tables in Epidemiology**

### **📖 Introduction**

In public health and demography, **life tables** are fundamental tools to summarise:

* **Mortality patterns**
* **Survival probabilities**
* **Life expectancy** for populations

They provide a detailed view of **how mortality rates affect a cohort across different ages**.

---

### **🔍 What is a Life Table?**

A **Life Table** is a tabular representation showing:
✅ **Probability of death** between age intervals
✅ **Number of survivors** at each age
✅ **Life expectancy** remaining at each age

Life tables are widely used by:

* **Epidemiologists** for disease-specific mortality
* **Demographers** for population analysis
* **Insurance and actuarial scientists** for premium calculations

---

### **📝 Types of Life Tables**

1. **Cohort (Generation) Life Table**

   * Follows an actual birth cohort until all members die
   * Historical, retrospective

2. **Period (Current) Life Table**

   * Uses mortality rates from a **specific period** to estimate life expectancy as if a hypothetical cohort experienced those rates throughout life

### **📑 Key Components**

| **Symbol** | **Meaning**                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| $x$        | Age interval start                                         |
| $l_x$      | Number of survivors at age *x*                             |
| $d_x$      | Number of deaths between *x* and *x+n*                     |
| $q_x$      | Probability of dying between *x* and *x+n*                 |
| $p_x$      | Probability of surviving between *x* and *x+n* (1 - $q_x$) |
| $L_x$      | Person-years lived between *x* and *x+n*                   |
| $T_x$      | Total person-years lived from age *x* onward               |
| $e_x$      | Life expectancy at age *x*                                 |

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Calculating **life expectancy**
✅ Understanding **age-specific mortality patterns**
✅ Designing **public health policies**
✅ Insurance and **actuarial analyses**

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

Here is a simplified life table for a cohort of **100,000 newborns**, showing mortality between ages 0-5 in 1-year intervals:

| **Age (x)** | **$l_x$** | **$d_x$** | **$q_x$** | **$p_x$** | **$L_x$** | **$T_x$** | **$e_x$** |
| ----------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0           | 100,000   | 5,000     | 0.050     | 0.950     | 97,500    | 475,000   | 4.75      |
| 1           | 95,000    | 1,000     | 0.0105    | 0.9895    | 94,500    | 377,500   | 3.97      |
| 2           | 94,000    | 500       | 0.0053    | 0.9947    | 93,750    | 283,000   | 3.01      |
| 3           | 93,500    | 500       | 0.0053    | 0.9947    | 93,250    | 189,250   | 2.02      |
| 4           | 93,000    | 250       | 0.0027    | 0.9973    | 92,875    | 96,000    | 1.03      |
| 5           | 92,750    | -         | -         | -         | -         | -         | -         |

*(Note: $L_x$ is approximated as average of $l_x$ and $l_{x+1}$. $T_x$ is cumulative sum of $L_x$ from age x onwards.)*

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Here is a **basic code** to calculate a simple life table from mortality data.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create example data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'age': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    'lx': [100000, 95000, 94000, 93500, 93000],
    'dx': [5000, 1000, 500, 500, 250]
})

# Calculate qx (probability of dying)
data['qx'] = data['dx'] / data['lx']

# Calculate px (probability of surviving)
data['px'] = 1 - data['qx']

# Calculate Lx (person-years lived)
data['lx_next'] = data['lx'].shift(-1)
data['Lx'] = (data['lx'] + data['lx_next']) / 2
data.loc[data['lx_next'].isnull(), 'Lx'] = data.loc[data['lx_next'].isnull(), 'lx'] / 2  # Last age interval

# Calculate Tx (total person-years remaining)
data['Tx'] = data['Lx'][::-1].cumsum()[::-1]

# Calculate ex (life expectancy)
data['ex'] = data['Tx'] / data['lx']

# Display the table
print(data[['age', 'lx', 'dx', 'qx', 'px', 'Lx', 'Tx', 'ex']].round(2))
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* **qx:** Probability of death in the age interval
* **px:** Probability of survival
* **Lx:** Person-years lived in the interval
* **Tx:** Total remaining person-years from age x onwards
* **ex:** Life expectancy at age x

✅ Public health professionals use **life tables to prioritise interventions** for age groups with higher mortality risks.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Life tables summarise survival and mortality** across age groups.
✅ They are essential in **demography, epidemiology, and insurance**.
✅ Provide estimates for **life expectancy and population health assessment**.
