## **🧬 Hazard Ratios**

### **📖 Introduction**

In **survival analysis**, we analyse not just **whether** an event occurs, but **when** it occurs. To quantify the effect of covariates on the timing of events, we use the **Hazard Ratio (HR)**.

Hazard Ratios are widely reported in:

* **Clinical trials** (e.g. drug efficacy studies)
* **Cohort studies** (e.g. effect of risk factors on mortality)

---

### **🔍 What is Hazard Ratio?**

A **Hazard Ratio (HR)** compares the **hazard (instantaneous event rate)** in two groups over time.

#### **Formula (conceptual)**

$$
HR = \frac{h_1(t)}{h_0(t)}
$$

Where:

* $h_1(t)$ = hazard function for group 1 (e.g. treatment group)
* $h_0(t)$ = hazard function for group 0 (e.g. control group)

✅ **HR = 1** → No difference in hazard between groups
✅ **HR > 1** → Increased hazard in group 1 (higher event rate)
✅ **HR < 1** → Decreased hazard in group 1 (protective effect)

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Analysing **time-to-event data**
✅ Comparing **event rates over time** between groups
✅ Adjusting for **covariates** using models like **Cox Proportional Hazards**

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

In a clinical trial:

* **Treatment group:** 200 patients
* **Control group:** 200 patients
* Patients were followed for **2 years** for mortality outcomes.

Using **Cox regression analysis**, the study reported:

* **Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.70**
* **95% Confidence Interval: (0.55, 0.90)**
* **p-value < 0.01**

---

### **📝 Interpretation**

✅ **HR = 0.70** means the **treatment group has a 30% lower hazard (risk of death)** compared to the control group **at any point in time**.

✅ **95% CI (0.55, 0.90)** does **not include 1**, indicating **statistical significance**.

✅ **p < 0.01** confirms this difference is unlikely due to chance.

### **💡 Key Differences: HR vs RR**

|                      | **Hazard Ratio (HR)** | **Relative Risk (RR)**    |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **What it measures** | Event rate over time  | Cumulative risk over time |
| **Used in**          | Survival analysis     | Cohort studies            |
| **Considers time?**  | ✅ Yes                 | ❌ No                      |

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Here is a **practical example using Cox PH model** to derive HR.

```python
# Install lifelines if not installed
# pip install lifelines

import pandas as pd
from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

# Example dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': [5, 6, 6, 2, 4, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8],
    'event': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'treatment': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
})

# Fit Cox model
cph = CoxPHFitter()
cph.fit(data, duration_col='time', event_col='event')

# Display results
cph.print_summary()

# Extract HR for treatment
hr = cph.hazard_ratios_['treatment']
print(f"Hazard Ratio for treatment: {hr:.2f}")
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* The output shows:

  * **Coefficient (log HR)**
  * **Hazard Ratio (exp(coef))**
  * **95% Confidence Interval**
  * **p-value**

✅ A **HR < 1** indicates a protective effect
✅ A **HR > 1** indicates increased hazard

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Hazard Ratios** quantify **relative event rates over time**, crucial in survival analysis.
✅ They are derived from **Cox regression models**.
✅ Widely used in clinical trials to assess **treatment effects on survival outcomes**.
