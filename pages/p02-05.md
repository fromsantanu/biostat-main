## **🧬 Binary Logistic Regression**

### **📖 Introduction**

In health research, many outcomes are **binary**, such as:

* Disease: Yes / No
* Treatment success: Yes / No
* Mortality: Alive / Dead

To analyse the **effect of one or more predictors** on a **binary outcome**, we use **Binary Logistic Regression**.

### **🔍 What is Binary Logistic Regression?**

**Binary Logistic Regression** is a statistical technique used to:

✅ Model the relationship between a **binary outcome variable** and one or more **independent variables** (predictors)
✅ Estimate **odds ratios (OR)** for predictors
✅ Predict **probability of an outcome**

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Logit Transformation**

Because probabilities range from 0 to 1, logistic regression models the **log odds (logit)** of the outcome:

$$
\text{logit}(p) = \ln \left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)
= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_p X_p
$$

Where:

* $p$ = probability of outcome occurring
* $\beta_0$ = intercept
* $\beta_i$ = coefficient for predictor $X_i$

---

#### **2. Odds Ratio (OR)**

$$
OR = e^{\beta_i}
$$

✅ **OR > 1:** Predictor increases odds of outcome
✅ **OR < 1:** Predictor decreases odds

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ **Binary outcome** variable
✅ Predictors can be **continuous or categorical**
✅ To adjust for **multiple covariates simultaneously**

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A study examines whether **smoking status** and **age** predict lung cancer occurrence.

| **Patient** | **Smoking (1=Yes)** | **Age** | **Lung Cancer (1=Yes)** |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| 1           | 1                   | 65      | 1                       |
| 2           | 0                   | 50      | 0                       |
| 3           | 1                   | 70      | 1                       |
| 4           | 0                   | 55      | 0                       |
| 5           | 1                   | 60      | 1                       |
| 6           | 0                   | 58      | 0                       |
| 7           | 1                   | 68      | 1                       |
| 8           | 0                   | 52      | 0                       |
| 9           | 1                   | 72      | 1                       |
| 10          | 0                   | 54      | 0                       |

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels library**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'smoking': [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0],
    'age': [65,50,70,55,60,58,68,52,72,54],
    'lung_cancer': [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
})

# Add intercept
data['intercept'] = 1

# Define predictors and outcome
X = data[['intercept', 'smoking', 'age']]
y = data['lung_cancer']

# Fit logistic regression model
model = sm.Logit(y, X)
result = model.fit()

# Display results
print(result.summary())
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* **Coefficient (β):** Change in log odds per unit increase in predictor
* **Odds Ratio (OR = exp(β)):** Effect size
* **p-value < 0.05:** Predictor significantly associated with outcome

✅ For example, OR for smoking = 5 implies **smokers have 5 times higher odds** of lung cancer compared to non-smokers, holding age constant.

---

### **💡 Model Outputs**

* **Log likelihood:** Model fit
* **Pseudo R²:** Approximate variance explained
* **Confidence intervals:** Precision of OR estimates

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Binary Logistic Regression** is used to model **binary outcomes with multiple predictors**
✅ Outputs **Odds Ratios** for interpreting effect sizes
✅ Essential for **epidemiology, clinical research, and public health studies**
