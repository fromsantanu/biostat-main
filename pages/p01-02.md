## **🧬 Survival Analysis – Log-Rank Test**

### **📖 Introduction**

While the **Kaplan-Meier estimator** provides survival curves for different groups, researchers often want to **compare these curves statistically** to determine:

* Is there a **significant difference in survival** between two or more groups?

This is achieved using the **Log-Rank Test**.

---

### **🔍 What is the Log-Rank Test?**

The **Log-Rank Test** is a **non-parametric hypothesis test** used to compare the **survival distributions** of two or more groups.

✅ It tests the **null hypothesis** that there is **no difference in survival** between groups.
✅ It is widely used in **clinical trials** to compare treatment groups.

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

* Compares **observed vs expected events** at each event time between groups.
* Assumes **proportional hazards** (i.e. risk ratio between groups is constant over time).
* Does **not specify the form of the survival distribution** (non-parametric).

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Comparing **Kaplan-Meier curves** between groups
✅ Data includes **censored observations**
✅ Groups are **independent**

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A clinical trial compares **two treatments (A and B)** for cancer patients. The study records survival times and event status:

| **Patient** | **Treatment** | **Time (months)** | **Event** |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 1           | A             | 6                 | 1         |
| 2           | A             | 7                 | 0         |
| 3           | A             | 9                 | 1         |
| 4           | A             | 10                | 1         |
| 5           | A             | 13                | 0         |
| 6           | B             | 8                 | 1         |
| 7           | B             | 12                | 1         |
| 8           | B             | 15                | 0         |
| 9           | B             | 18                | 1         |
| 10          | B             | 20                | 0         |

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Here is a **step-by-step code** using `lifelines`:

```python
# Install lifelines if not installed
# pip install lifelines

import pandas as pd
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
from lifelines.statistics import logrank_test
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': [6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 8, 12, 15, 18, 20],
    'event': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    'treatment': ['A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'B']
})

# Split data into two groups
group_a = data[data['treatment'] == 'A']
group_b = data[data['treatment'] == 'B']

# Kaplan-Meier fit for each group
kmf_a = KaplanMeierFitter()
kmf_b = KaplanMeierFitter()

kmf_a.fit(group_a['time'], event_observed=group_a['event'], label='Treatment A')
kmf_b.fit(group_b['time'], event_observed=group_b['event'], label='Treatment B')

# Plot survival curves
ax = kmf_a.plot_survival_function()
kmf_b.plot_survival_function(ax=ax)
plt.title('Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves by Treatment')
plt.xlabel('Time (months)')
plt.ylabel('Survival Probability')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Perform Log-Rank Test
results = logrank_test(
    group_a['time'], group_b['time'],
    event_observed_A=group_a['event'],
    event_observed_B=group_b['event']
)

# Print p-value
print("Log-Rank Test p-value:", results.p_value)
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant difference in survival between treatments.
* **p-value ≥ 0.05:** No significant difference.

In this example, interpret the p-value to decide whether **Treatment A or B leads to better survival outcomes**.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ The Log-Rank Test is essential for **comparing survival curves**.
✅ It works under the assumption of **proportional hazards**.
✅ Widely used in **clinical trials** and epidemiological research.
