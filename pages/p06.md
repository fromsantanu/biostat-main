## **🧬 Sample Size and Power Calculations – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

Before conducting any clinical trial or epidemiological study, it is crucial to determine:

✅ **How many participants are needed?**
✅ **Is the study adequately powered to detect a meaningful effect?**

This ensures that the study is:

* **Statistically valid** (avoiding Type II errors – failing to detect true effects)
* **Ethically justified** (not exposing unnecessary participants to interventions or risks)
* **Economically feasible** (resource planning and grant applications)

---

### **🔍 What are Sample Size and Power Calculations?**

✅ **Sample Size Calculation:** Determines the **minimum number of participants** required to detect a specified effect size with a given significance level (α) and power (1–β).

✅ **Power Calculation:** Determines the **probability that the study will detect a true effect** if it exists, given the sample size and effect size.

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Effect Size**

* **Magnitude of difference** the study aims to detect (e.g. mean difference, risk ratio).

#### **2. Significance Level (α)**

* Probability of **Type I error** (false positive). Commonly set at **0.05**.

#### **3. Power (1–β)**

* Probability of **correctly detecting a true effect**. Commonly set at **80% or 90%**.

#### **4. Variability**

* **Standard deviation (SD)** for continuous outcomes
* **Event rate (proportion)** for categorical outcomes

#### **5. One-tailed vs Two-tailed tests**

* Two-tailed is used unless a **directional hypothesis** is strictly justified.

### **💡 Why is this Important?**

✅ Ensures studies are **neither underpowered (inconclusive)** nor **overpowered (unnecessarily large)**
✅ Required for **ethical committee approvals and grant proposals**
