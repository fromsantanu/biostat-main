## **🧬 Sample Size for Comparing Means**

### **📖 Introduction**

When planning a study comparing **means between two groups** (e.g. treatment vs control), it is crucial to calculate the **minimum sample size required** to:

✅ Detect a **specified mean difference** (effect size)
✅ With chosen **significance level (α)** and **power (1–β)**

---

### **🔍 When to Use**

✅ Comparing **means of continuous variables** between two independent groups (e.g. blood pressure, HbA1c, weight loss).

---

### **📝 Key Formula (Two-sided test)**

For **two independent groups with equal variances**:

$$
n = \frac{2 \times (Z_{\alpha/2} + Z_{\beta})^2 \times \sigma^2}{\Delta^2}
$$

Where:

* **n:** Sample size per group
* **Zα/2:** Z value for two-tailed significance level (e.g. 1.96 for α=0.05)
* **Zβ:** Z value for power (e.g. 0.84 for 80% power)
* **σ:** Standard deviation (pooled or estimated)
* **Δ:** Minimum detectable difference (effect size)

---

### **💡 Key Concepts**

✅ **Effect Size (Δ):** Smallest meaningful difference to detect
✅ **Standard Deviation (σ):** Reflects variability in outcome measure
✅ **Alpha (α):** Type I error rate (commonly 0.05)
✅ **Power (1–β):** Desired probability to detect true effect (commonly 0.80 or 0.90)

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A researcher plans to compare **mean systolic BP** between two groups (treatment vs control). Based on previous studies:

* **Expected SD (σ):** 15 mmHg
* **Minimum detectable difference (Δ):** 10 mmHg
* **Alpha (α):** 0.05 (two-tailed)
* **Power (1–β):** 80%

---

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Find Zα/2 and Zβ**

* Zα/2 = 1.96 (for 95% CI, two-tailed)
* Zβ = 0.84 (for 80% power)

---

2. **Apply formula**

$$
n = \frac{2 \times (1.96 + 0.84)^2 \times 15^2}{10^2}
$$

$$
n = \frac{2 \times (2.8)^2 \times 225}{100}
$$

$$
n = \frac{2 \times 7.84 \times 225}{100}
$$

$$
n = \frac{2 \times 1764}{100}
$$

$$
n = \frac{3528}{100}
$$

$$
n = 35.28
$$

✅ **Sample size required per group = 36 participants (rounded up).**

---

### **💡 Adjustments**

✅ **Unequal group sizes:** Formula slightly adjusts weights
✅ **Multiple comparisons:** Adjust α to control for Type I error inflation

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels.stats.power module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

from statsmodels.stats.power import TTestIndPower

# Define parameters
effect_size = 10 / 15  # Δ / σ
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.80

# Create analysis object
analysis = TTestIndPower()

# Calculate sample size
n = analysis.solve_power(effect_size=effect_size, alpha=alpha, power=power, alternative='two-sided')

print(f"Sample size per group: {n:.0f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Effect size (Cohen’s d)** = Δ / σ = 10 / 15 = 0.67
✅ Sample size **per group \~36** for detecting a 10 mmHg difference with 80% power at 5% significance level.

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Assumes **normal distribution and equal variances**
❌ Requires **prior estimation of SD and clinically meaningful difference**

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ Sample size calculation ensures **statistical validity and ethical justification**
✅ Depends on **effect size, variability, alpha, and power**
✅ Essential for **study design, grant proposals, and protocol development**
