## **🧬 Survival Analysis – Kaplan-Meier Estimator**

### **📖 Introduction**

In clinical research, we often study **time-to-event data** – for example:

* Time until death in cancer patients
* Time until relapse after treatment
* Time until recovery from an infection

Traditional statistical techniques like t-tests or ANOVA are **not suitable** here because:
✅ Data can be **censored** (patient drops out or study ends before event occurs)
✅ Time-to-event data is **not normally distributed**

This is where **Kaplan-Meier estimation** becomes essential.

### **🔍 What is the Kaplan-Meier Estimator?**

The **Kaplan-Meier estimator** is a **non-parametric method** used to estimate the **survival function** from time-to-event data. It calculates the **probability of surviving** beyond certain time points.

✅ It handles **censored data** effectively
✅ Provides **stepwise survival curves** to visualise survival over time

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

* **Event:** The outcome of interest (death, relapse, recovery)
* **Censoring:** When the exact event time is unknown (patient left study or event not yet occurred by end of study)
* **Survival Function (S(t)):** Probability of surviving longer than time *t*

---

### **📊 Formula**

If there are *k* distinct event times:

$$
S(t) = \prod_{t_i \le t} \left( \frac{n_i - d_i}{n_i} \right)
$$

Where:

* $n_i$ = number at risk just before time $t_i$
* $d_i$ = number of events at time $t_i$

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Analysing **time-to-event data**
✅ Data includes **censored observations**
✅ Comparing **survival experiences** across groups

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A study follows **10 patients** after cancer treatment to record survival times (in months):

| **Patient** | **Time (months)** | **Event Occurred?** |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| 1           | 6                 | Yes                 |
| 2           | 7                 | No (censored)       |
| 3           | 9                 | Yes                 |
| 4           | 10                | Yes                 |
| 5           | 13                | No (censored)       |
| 6           | 15                | Yes                 |
| 7           | 17                | Yes                 |
| 8           | 19                | No (censored)       |
| 9           | 25                | Yes                 |
| 10          | 30                | No (censored)       |

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Here is a **step-by-step code** using `lifelines` library:

```python
# Install lifelines if not installed
# pip install lifelines

import pandas as pd
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'time': [6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 25, 30],
    'event': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
})

# Instantiate the Kaplan-Meier fitter
kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()

# Fit the model
kmf.fit(durations=data['time'], event_observed=data['event'])

# Plot the survival function
kmf.plot_survival_function()
plt.title('Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve')
plt.xlabel('Time (months)')
plt.ylabel('Survival Probability')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# View the survival probabilities at each event time
print(kmf.survival_function_)
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* The **Kaplan-Meier curve** shows probability of survival over time.
* **Downward steps** occur at each event time.
* **Flat segments** indicate periods with no events.
* Censored data are shown as tick marks on the curve (when plotted using advanced options).

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ The Kaplan-Meier estimator is fundamental for **survival analysis**.
✅ It accommodates **censored data** efficiently.
✅ It is widely used in **clinical trials** to visualise survival experiences.
