## **🧬 General Linear Model for Repeated Measures (ANOVA)**

### **📖 Introduction**

When a study measures the **same outcome multiple times on the same subjects** (e.g. before and after treatment, or at different time points), we use **Repeated Measures ANOVA** to test:

✅ Whether there is a **significant change in means** across time or conditions
✅ Whether treatment or time has an **overall effect**

---

### **🔍 What is Repeated Measures ANOVA?**

**Repeated Measures ANOVA** is an extension of the general linear model (GLM) for **within-subject designs**, analysing differences **within individuals over time or across conditions**.

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

* **Within-subject factor:** The repeated measure (e.g. time points, treatment conditions)
* **Between-subject factor:** Grouping variable (e.g. treatment vs control group)

#### **Assumptions**

✅ Normality of differences
✅ Sphericity (equal variances of differences between all pairs of time points). Violations are adjusted using **Greenhouse-Geisser or Huynh-Feldt corrections**.

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Measurements are **repeated on the same subjects**
✅ Outcome is **continuous** and approximately **normally distributed**
✅ Testing **mean differences** across time points or conditions

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A study measured **blood pressure (BP)** of **10 patients** at **3 time points**:

| **Patient** | **Baseline** | **Week 2** | **Week 4** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 140          | 135        | 130        |
| 2           | 150          | 148        | 145        |
| 3           | 160          | 158        | 155        |
| 4           | 145          | 140        | 135        |
| 5           | 155          | 150        | 145        |
| 6           | 150          | 148        | 142        |
| 7           | 148          | 145        | 140        |
| 8           | 152          | 150        | 145        |
| 9           | 160          | 155        | 150        |
| 10          | 158          | 153        | 150        |

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels and pandas (wide to long data transformation)**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.stats.anova import AnovaRM

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'patient': range(1,11),
    'baseline': [140,150,160,145,155,150,148,152,160,158],
    'week2': [135,148,158,140,150,148,145,150,155,153],
    'week4': [130,145,155,135,145,142,140,145,150,150]
})

# Convert from wide to long format
data_long = pd.melt(data, id_vars=['patient'],
                    value_vars=['baseline','week2','week4'],
                    var_name='time', value_name='bp')

# Fit Repeated Measures ANOVA
aovrm = AnovaRM(data_long, 'bp', 'patient', within=['time'])
result = aovrm.fit()

print(result)
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

* **F-statistic:** Tests overall time effect
* **p-value < 0.05:** Significant differences exist among time points
* Post-hoc tests are performed to identify **which time points differ** (not covered here).

---

### **💡 Limitations**

* Assumes **sphericity** (equal variances of differences). If violated, corrections are applied.
* Cannot handle **missing data easily**; Mixed models are preferable in such cases.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Repeated Measures ANOVA** tests for **mean differences across time or conditions** within the same subjects
✅ Adjusts for **within-subject correlations**
✅ Suitable when data is **balanced and complete** with approximately normal outcomes
