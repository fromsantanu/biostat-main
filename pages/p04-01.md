## **🧬 Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis**

### **📖 Introduction**

In meta-analysis, when combining results from multiple studies, the **Fixed Effect model** is the simplest approach, assuming:

✅ All studies estimate the **same true effect size**
✅ Differences in results are due only to **sampling error (within-study variability)**

---

### **🔍 What is Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis?**

**Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis**:

✅ Combines study estimates assuming a **common underlying effect**
✅ Weights each study by its **precision (inverse of variance)**

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Weighting**

Each study is weighted by:

$$
w_i = \frac{1}{SE_i^2}
$$

Where $SE_i$ is the standard error of the study’s effect estimate.

---

#### **2. Pooled Effect Estimate**

$$
\hat{\theta}_{FE}
= \frac{\sum w_i \theta_i}{\sum w_i}
$$

Where:

* $\theta_i$ = effect estimate from study *i*
* $w_i$ = weight of study *i*

---

#### **3. Variance of Pooled Estimate**

$$
Var(\hat{\theta}_{FE}) = \frac{1}{\sum w_i}
$$

And standard error (SE) is the square root of variance.

---

#### **4. 95% Confidence Interval**

$$
CI = \hat{\theta}_{FE} \pm 1.96 \times SE
$$

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Studies are **homogeneous** (no significant heterogeneity)
✅ Research question assumes **single common effect**

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

Five studies estimate the **risk ratio (RR)** of a new treatment vs placebo:

| **Study** | **Effect Estimate (RR)** | **Standard Error (SE)** |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1         | 0.80                     | 0.10                    |
| 2         | 0.85                     | 0.12                    |
| 3         | 0.78                     | 0.15                    |
| 4         | 0.82                     | 0.09                    |
| 5         | 0.88                     | 0.11                    |

---

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Calculate weights**

$$
w_i = \frac{1}{SE_i^2}
$$

| Study | SE   | Weight |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 1     | 0.10 | 100.0  |
| 2     | 0.12 | 69.44  |
| 3     | 0.15 | 44.44  |
| 4     | 0.09 | 123.46 |
| 5     | 0.11 | 82.64  |

---

2. **Calculate pooled effect**

$$
\hat{\theta}_{FE}
= \frac{(100*0.80)+(69.44*0.85)+(44.44*0.78)+(123.46*0.82)+(82.64*0.88)}{100+69.44+44.44+123.46+82.64}
$$

$$
= \frac{80+59+34.67+101.24+72.72}{420}
$$

$$
= \frac{347.63}{420}
= 0.827
$$

---

3. **Calculate variance and 95% CI**

$$
Var = \frac{1}{420}
= 0.00238
$$

$$
SE = \sqrt{0.00238}
= 0.0488
$$

$$
CI = 0.827 \pm 1.96 \times 0.0488
= (0.731, 0.923)
$$

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **numpy and pandas for manual calculation**:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'study': [1,2,3,4,5],
    'RR': [0.80,0.85,0.78,0.82,0.88],
    'SE': [0.10,0.12,0.15,0.09,0.11]
})

# Calculate weights
data['weight'] = 1 / data['SE']**2

# Calculate pooled estimate
pooled_effect = (data['RR'] * data['weight']).sum() / data['weight'].sum()

# Calculate variance and CI
variance = 1 / data['weight'].sum()
SE_pooled = np.sqrt(variance)
CI_lower = pooled_effect - 1.96 * SE_pooled
CI_upper = pooled_effect + 1.96 * SE_pooled

print(f"Pooled RR: {pooled_effect:.3f}")
print(f"95% CI: ({CI_lower:.3f}, {CI_upper:.3f})")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Pooled RR = 0.827 (95% CI: 0.731, 0.923)**
✅ Treatment reduces risk by \~17% compared to placebo.
✅ Assumes **no between-study heterogeneity**.

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Assumes **true effect is identical** across studies
❌ If heterogeneity exists, **Random Effects Meta-Analysis** is preferred.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis** combines studies under the assumption of **single true effect**
✅ Weights studies by **inverse of variance (precision)**
✅ Provides **pooled estimate and CI** for decision making
