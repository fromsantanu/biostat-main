## **🧬 Longitudinal and Repeated Measures Analysis – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

In clinical, biomedical, and public health research, we often collect **multiple measurements from the same subjects over time** or under different conditions. For example:

* **Blood pressure measurements** at multiple visits
* **Growth measurements** of children over years
* **Repeated lab results** during hospitalisation

These data are **not independent**, and require **specialised analysis techniques** under **Longitudinal and Repeated Measures Analysis**.

### **🔍 What is Longitudinal and Repeated Measures Analysis?**

✅ **Longitudinal analysis** deals with data collected **over time from the same subjects** to examine trends and changes.

✅ **Repeated measures analysis** is a broader term that includes **any multiple measurements from the same subjects**, whether over time or under different experimental conditions.

Both account for:

* **Within-subject correlations** (observations from the same person are related)
* **Between-subject variability**

### **📝 Why is this important?**

Standard statistical methods assume **independence of observations**. Using them for repeated data:

❌ Underestimates standard errors
❌ Inflates Type I error rates (false positives)

### **📑 What You Will Learn in This Section**

This chapter introduces **key techniques for analysing longitudinal and repeated measures data**, including:

1. **General Linear Model for Repeated Measures (ANOVA)**
2. **Linear Mixed Effects Models**
3. **Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)**

---

### **💡 Applications**

✅ Analysing **treatment effects over time** in clinical trials
✅ Studying **growth trajectories** in cohort studies
✅ Evaluating **within-subject intervention effects**

---

### **🎯 Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

✅ Understand the **conceptual differences** between models
✅ Select the **appropriate technique** for different study designs
✅ Perform these analyses using **Python or R**
✅ Interpret results in a **clinical and epidemiological context**
