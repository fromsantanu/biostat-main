## **🧬 Sample Size for Comparing Proportions**

### **📖 Introduction**

When planning a study to **compare proportions** (e.g. success rates, prevalence, response rates) between two groups, it is essential to calculate the **minimum sample size required** to:

✅ Detect a **specified difference in proportions**
✅ With chosen **significance level (α)** and **power (1–β)**

---

### **🔍 When to Use**

✅ Comparing **binary outcomes** between two independent groups

Examples:

* Proportion of disease cure in treatment vs control group
* Prevalence of risk factor between two populations

---

### **📝 Key Formula (Two-sided test)**

For comparing **two independent proportions**:

$$
n = \frac{ \left[ Z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{2p(1-p)} + Z_{\beta} \sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)} \right]^2 }{ (p_1 - p_2)^2 }
$$

Where:

* **n:** Sample size per group
* **p₁, p₂:** Expected proportions in each group
* **p:** Pooled proportion = (p₁ + p₂) / 2
* **Zα/2:** Z value for two-tailed α (e.g. 1.96 for α=0.05)
* **Zβ:** Z value for desired power (e.g. 0.84 for 80% power)

---

### **💡 Key Concepts**

✅ **Effect size (p₁ – p₂):** Minimum difference to detect
✅ **Alpha (α):** Type I error rate (commonly 0.05)
✅ **Power (1–β):** Desired probability to detect true difference (commonly 0.80 or 0.90)

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A study aims to compare **cure rates** of a new drug vs placebo:

* **Expected cure rate with drug (p₁):** 70% (0.70)
* **Expected cure rate with placebo (p₂):** 50% (0.50)
* **Alpha (α):** 0.05 (two-tailed)
* **Power (1–β):** 80%

---

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Calculate pooled proportion (p)**

$$
p = \frac{0.70 + 0.50}{2}
= 0.60
$$

---

2. **Find Zα/2 and Zβ**

* Zα/2 = 1.96 (for 95% CI, two-tailed)
* Zβ = 0.84 (for 80% power)

---

3. **Apply formula**

$$
n = \frac{ [1.96 \sqrt{2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4} + 0.84 \sqrt{0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times 0.5}]^2 }{ (0.7 - 0.5)^2 }
$$

Calculate each part stepwise:

* $\sqrt{2 \times 0.6 \times 0.4} = \sqrt{0.48} = 0.6928$
* $\sqrt{0.7 \times 0.3 + 0.5 \times 0.5} = \sqrt{0.21 + 0.25} = \sqrt{0.46} = 0.6782$

Then:

* $1.96 \times 0.6928 = 1.3578$
* $0.84 \times 0.6782 = 0.5697$
* Sum = 1.3578 + 0.5697 = 1.9275
* Square = 1.9275² = 3.717

Finally, divide by effect size squared:

* $(0.7 - 0.5)^2 = 0.04$

$$
n = \frac{3.717}{0.04}
= 92.9
$$

✅ **Sample size required per group = 93 participants (rounded up).**

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels.stats.power module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

from statsmodels.stats.power import NormalIndPower

# Define parameters
p1 = 0.70
p2 = 0.50
effect_size = abs(p1 - p2)
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.80

# Calculate pooled standard deviation for effect size
pooled_sd = ((p1*(1-p1) + p2*(1-p2))/2)**0.5
standardized_effect_size = effect_size / pooled_sd

# Create analysis object
analysis = NormalIndPower()

# Calculate sample size
n = analysis.solve_power(effect_size=standardized_effect_size, alpha=alpha, power=power, alternative='two-sided')

print(f"Sample size per group: {n:.0f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Effect size = 0.20** (20% difference)
✅ Sample size **per group \~93** to detect this difference with 80% power at 5% significance level.

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Requires prior estimates of **expected proportions**
❌ For **unequal group sizes or cluster designs**, adjustments are needed

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ Sample size for comparing proportions ensures **statistical validity** when studying **binary outcomes**
✅ Depends on **expected proportions, effect size, alpha, and power**
✅ Essential for planning **clinical trials, intervention studies, and prevalence comparisons**
