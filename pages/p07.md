## **🧬 Non-Parametric Statistical Methods – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

In biostatistics, most common tests (e.g. t-test, ANOVA) require **parametric assumptions**, such as:

✅ **Normal distribution** of data
✅ **Equal variances** across groups

However, real-world biomedical data often violate these assumptions. **Non-parametric tests** provide robust alternatives that:

✅ Do **not assume normality**
✅ Are based on **ranks rather than actual values**
✅ Can handle **small sample sizes and ordinal data**

---

### **🔍 What are Non-Parametric Tests?**

**Non-parametric tests** are statistical methods used when:

✅ Data is **ordinal or not normally distributed**
✅ Sample sizes are too **small for parametric assumptions to hold**

---

### **📝 Why are They Important?**

✅ More **robust to outliers and non-normal data**
✅ Useful for **ordinal variables, skewed distributions, and non-quantitative scales**

Examples in biomedical research include:

* Comparing **pain scores (ordinal)** between treatment groups
* Analysing **median hospital stay durations** where data is skewed

### **📑 What You Will Learn in This Section**

This chapter introduces **key non-parametric statistical techniques**, including:

1. **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**
2. **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (Mann-Whitney U Test)**
3. **Kruskal-Wallis Test**
4. **Friedman Test**
5. **Spearman’s Rank Correlation**

---

### **💡 Applications**

✅ Comparing **medians between groups**
✅ Analysing **paired non-normal data**
✅ Measuring **association between ranked variables**

---

### **🎯 Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

✅ Identify when **non-parametric methods are appropriate**
✅ Conduct common non-parametric tests
✅ Interpret results within **clinical and public health contexts**
✅ Implement these analyses using **Python or R**
