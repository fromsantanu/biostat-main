## **🧬 Sample Size for Regression Analysis**

### **📖 Introduction**

When planning **regression analyses** (e.g. multiple linear regression, logistic regression), it is important to ensure:

✅ **Sufficient sample size** to detect significant relationships
✅ Avoidance of **overfitting** with too many predictors and too few observations

---

### **🔍 When to Use**

✅ Studies with **continuous or categorical outcomes**
✅ Multiple predictors included in the model

---

### **📝 Key Rules of Thumb**

#### **1. Events per Variable (EPV) Rule**

For **logistic regression**:

* **Minimum EPV = 10**

✅ At least **10 outcome events per predictor variable** included in the model.

Example:

* If outcome event (e.g. disease occurrence) is **20%**, and you plan **5 predictors**, you need:

$$
10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ events}
$$

Thus,

$$
Total\ sample\ size = \frac{50}{0.20} = 250
$$

---

#### **2. Green’s Formula (Linear Regression)**

For **multiple linear regression**:

$$
n \ge 50 + 8m
$$

Where **m** = number of predictors.

✅ Ensures **adequate power (80%)** for testing individual predictors.

---

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A researcher plans a **multiple linear regression** with:

* **Outcome:** Blood pressure (continuous)
* **Predictors:** Age, BMI, smoking status, exercise frequency (4 predictors)

---

#### **Calculation Using Green’s Formula**

$$
n \ge 50 + 8 \times 4
$$

$$
n \ge 50 + 32
$$

$$
n \ge 82
$$

✅ **Minimum sample size required = 82 participants**

---

### **💡 Alternative Approach: Effect Size Based Calculation**

Using **power analysis** for multiple regression:

$$
n = \frac{ (Z_{\alpha/2} + Z_{\beta})^2 }{ f^2 } + m + 1
$$

Where:

* **f²:** Cohen’s effect size (small=0.02, medium=0.15, large=0.35)
* **m:** Number of predictors

*(Detailed derivation involves noncentral F-distribution and is computed using software.)*

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels.stats.power module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels

from statsmodels.stats.power import FTestPower

# Define parameters
effect_size = 0.15  # medium effect size (Cohen's f²)
alpha = 0.05
power = 0.80
num_predictors = 4

# Create analysis object
analysis = FTestPower()

# Calculate sample size
n = analysis.solve_power(effect_size=effect_size, df_num=num_predictors, alpha=alpha, power=power)

# Adjust total sample size (including predictors)
total_n = n + num_predictors + 1

print(f"Sample size required: {total_n:.0f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ For **medium effect size (f²=0.15)** with **4 predictors**, **power=80%**, and **α=0.05**, sample size is calculated accordingly.

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Estimates depend on **assumed effect size** (small effects require large samples)
❌ **EPV rule** for logistic regression is a guideline; modern studies may require **higher EPV** (e.g. 20) for stability.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ Sample size for regression analysis ensures **reliable estimation of predictor effects**
✅ Depends on **number of predictors, expected effect sizes, alpha, and power**
✅ Critical for **clinical prediction models, epidemiological studies, and multivariable analyses**
