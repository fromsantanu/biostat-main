## **🧬 Credible Intervals vs Confidence Intervals**

### **📖 Introduction**

Both **credible intervals (Bayesian)** and **confidence intervals (Frequentist)** are used to express **uncertainty about parameter estimates**. However, they have fundamentally different interpretations.

### **🔍 What is a Confidence Interval (CI)?**

✅ Derived from **frequentist statistics**

* For a **95% CI**, if we repeat the study infinitely many times, **95% of such intervals will contain the true parameter**.

❌ **Does not** mean there is a 95% probability that the true parameter lies within this specific interval.

---

### **🔍 What is a Credible Interval?**

✅ Derived from **Bayesian statistics**

* For a **95% credible interval**, there is a **95% probability that the true parameter lies within this interval**, given the observed data and prior belief.

✅ Represents **direct probability statements** about parameters.

| **Approach**       | Frequentist                                                                       | Bayesian                                                                    |
| **Interpretation** | If repeated sampling were done, **95% of intervals** would contain true parameter | There is a **95% probability** that the parameter lies within this interval |
| **Depends on**     | Data only                                                                         | Data + Prior                                                                |
| **Philosophy**     | Parameter is fixed, interval varies                                               | Parameter is variable (distribution), interval is fixed                     |

### **💡 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario: Estimating Mean Blood Pressure Reduction**

1. **Frequentist CI result:** (5 mmHg, 15 mmHg)

✅ Interpretation: If the study were repeated infinitely, **95% of such intervals would cover the true mean reduction**.

❌ Cannot say there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies in this interval.

---

2. **Bayesian credible interval result:** (5 mmHg, 15 mmHg)

✅ Interpretation: Given the data and prior, there is a **95% probability that the true mean reduction lies between 5 and 15 mmHg**.

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **Bayesian credible interval example** via pymc3 (Bayesian modeling library):

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install pymc3 arviz

import pymc3 as pm
import arviz as az
import numpy as np

# Simulated data: BP reduction
data = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=5, size=30)

# Bayesian model
with pm.Model() as model:
    mu = pm.Normal('mu', mu=0, sigma=10)  # prior
    sigma = pm.HalfNormal('sigma', sigma=10)
    y_obs = pm.Normal('y_obs', mu=mu, sigma=sigma, observed=data)
    
    trace = pm.sample(2000, return_inferencedata=True, progressbar=False)

# Calculate 95% credible interval
ci = az.hdi(trace, hdi_prob=0.95)
print(ci)
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **HDI (Highest Density Interval)** shows the **most credible range** containing 95% of posterior probability mass.

---

### **💡 Applications**

* **Credible intervals:** Bayesian clinical trials, adaptive designs, incorporating prior knowledge
* **Confidence intervals:** Traditional frequentist analyses in standard statistical reports

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ **Credible intervals depend on prior specification**
❌ Misinterpretation of confidence intervals is common in practice

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Credible Interval:** Probability statement about parameter given data and prior
✅ **Confidence Interval:** Long-run frequency property; does not provide direct probability about parameter
✅ Both are useful but require **careful interpretation within their philosophical frameworks**
