## **🧬 Relative Risk and Odds Ratio**

### **📖 Introduction**

In epidemiology, to assess whether an **exposure is associated with a disease or outcome**, two fundamental measures are used:

✅ **Relative Risk (RR)** – Used mainly in **cohort studies**
✅ **Odds Ratio (OR)** – Used mainly in **case-control studies**

These measures quantify the **strength of association** between exposure and outcome, helping in risk assessment and decision-making.

### **🔍 What is Relative Risk (RR)?**

**Relative Risk (RR)** is the **ratio of the probability** of an event (e.g. disease) occurring in the exposed group to the probability in the unexposed group.

#### **Formula**

$$
RR = \frac{Risk_{exposed}}{Risk_{unexposed}}
$$

✅ **RR = 1** → No association
✅ **RR > 1** → Increased risk (positive association)
✅ **RR < 1** → Decreased risk (protective effect)

---

### **🔍 What is Odds Ratio (OR)?**

**Odds Ratio (OR)** is the **ratio of odds** of exposure among cases to odds of exposure among controls.

#### **Formula**

For a **2x2 table**:

|               | Disease + | Disease - |
| ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Exposed**   | a         | b         |
| **Unexposed** | c         | d         |

$$
OR = \frac{a/c}{b/d}
= \frac{a \times d}{b \times c}
$$

✅ Used in **case-control studies** where incidence rates cannot be directly calculated.
✅ Also used in logistic regression outputs.

### **💡 Key Differences**

| **Measure**            | **Study type**       | **Interpretation**                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Relative Risk (RR)** | Cohort studies, RCTs | Risk of disease in exposed relative to unexposed |
| **Odds Ratio (OR)**    | Case-control studies | Odds of exposure among cases vs controls         |

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A cohort study examined whether **smoking** increases risk of lung cancer:

|                 | **Lung Cancer +** | **Lung Cancer -** | **Total** |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **Smokers**     | 90                | 910               | 1000      |
| **Non-Smokers** | 10                | 990               | 1000      |
| **Total**       | 100               | 1900              | 2000      |

---

#### **Calculate Relative Risk (RR)**

$$
Risk_{smokers}
= \frac{90}{1000}
= 0.09
$$

$$
Risk_{non-smokers}
= \frac{10}{1000}
= 0.01
$$

$$
RR = \frac{0.09}{0.01}
= 9.0
$$

✅ **Interpretation:** Smokers have **9 times higher risk** of developing lung cancer compared to non-smokers.

---

#### **Calculate Odds Ratio (OR)**

$$
OR = \frac{90 \times 990}{910 \times 10}
= \frac{89100}{9100}
= 9.79
$$

✅ **Interpretation:** The odds of lung cancer among smokers is approximately **9.8 times** that of non-smokers.

---

### **💡 Note**

* In **rare diseases**, **OR approximates RR** closely.
* In **common diseases**, OR **overestimates** RR.

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Here is a **simple code snippet**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create contingency table data
a, b, c, d = 90, 910, 10, 990

# Calculate RR
risk_smokers = a / (a + b)
risk_nonsmokers = c / (c + d)
rr = risk_smokers / risk_nonsmokers

# Calculate OR
or_ = (a * d) / (b * c)

print(f"Relative Risk (RR): {rr:.2f}")
print(f"Odds Ratio (OR): {or_:.2f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **RR > 1:** Positive association; exposure increases risk
✅ **RR < 1:** Protective effect
✅ **OR > 1:** Positive association (especially used when RR cannot be calculated)

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Relative Risk** measures **risk ratio** in cohort/RCT studies.
✅ **Odds Ratio** measures **odds ratio** in case-control studies and logistic regression.
✅ Both are crucial for **understanding disease-exposure relationships** in epidemiology.
