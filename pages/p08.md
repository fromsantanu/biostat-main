## **🧬 Bayesian Statistics in Biostatistics – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

**Bayesian statistics** is an alternative to traditional frequentist statistics. It incorporates:

✅ **Prior knowledge or beliefs** about parameters
✅ **Data evidence** to update beliefs and obtain **posterior probabilities**

In biostatistics, Bayesian methods are increasingly used for:

* **Clinical trial analysis**
* **Adaptive trial designs**
* **Diagnostic test evaluation**
* **Risk prediction models**

---

### **🔍 What is Bayesian Statistics?**

Bayesian approach is based on **Bayes’ Theorem**, which states:

$$
Posterior \propto Likelihood \times Prior
$$

Where:

* **Prior:** Initial belief about parameter (before data)
* **Likelihood:** Probability of observing the data given the parameter
* **Posterior:** Updated belief about parameter after observing data

### **📝 Why is it Important?**

✅ Allows integration of **previous study results or expert opinion (prior information)**
✅ Provides **probabilistic interpretation** of results (e.g. “There is 95% probability that treatment effect is between X and Y”)
✅ Supports **flexible modeling**, especially in complex hierarchical or adaptive designs

### **💡 Key Differences vs Frequentist**

| **Aspect**        | **Frequentist**                       | **Bayesian**                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Interpretation    | Probability as **long-run frequency** | Probability as **degree of belief**         |
| Parameters        | Fixed unknown quantities              | Random variables with distributions         |
| Inference         | p-values, confidence intervals        | Posterior distributions, credible intervals |
| Prior information | Not incorporated                      | Explicitly incorporated                     |
