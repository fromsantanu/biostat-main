## **🧬 SIR Model for Infectious Disease Spread**

### **📖 Introduction**

The **SIR model** is a foundational compartmental model in epidemiology. It divides the population into three compartments:

✅ **S:** Susceptible – individuals who can catch the disease
✅ **I:** Infectious – individuals who have the disease and can transmit it
✅ **R:** Recovered (or Removed) – individuals who have recovered (and are immune) or died

---

### **🔍 What is the SIR Model?**

The **SIR model** describes how individuals move between these compartments over time due to infection and recovery.

### **📝 Key Equations**

The model is defined by the following differential equations:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = - \beta S I
$$

$$
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta S I - \gamma I
$$

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma I
$$

Where:

* **β (beta):** Transmission rate
* **γ (gamma):** Recovery rate

✅ **Basic reproduction number (R₀):**

$$
R_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}
$$

It represents the **average number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual in a fully susceptible population**.

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

In a population of **1000 individuals**:

* Initially **1 infectious person**
* **999 susceptible individuals**
* **β = 0.3**, **γ = 0.1**

✅ Calculate the disease spread over **160 days**.

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **scipy.integrate.odeint** to solve the system of differential equations:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install numpy scipy matplotlib

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Total population
N = 1000
I0 = 1
R0 = 0
S0 = N - I0 - R0

# Parameters
beta = 0.3
gamma = 0.1

# Time grid (days)
t = np.linspace(0, 160, 160)

# SIR model differential equations
def sir(y, t, N, beta, gamma):
    S, I, R = y
    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N
    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I
    dRdt = gamma * I
    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt

# Initial conditions vector
y0 = S0, I0, R0

# Integrate SIR equations
ret = odeint(sir, y0, t, args=(N, beta, gamma))
S, I, R = ret.T

# Plot results
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
plt.plot(t, S, label='Susceptible')
plt.plot(t, I, label='Infectious')
plt.plot(t, R, label='Recovered')
plt.xlabel('Days')
plt.ylabel('Number of individuals')
plt.title('SIR Model Simulation')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ The **peak of infectious individuals** indicates when the epidemic is at its worst.
✅ **R₀ = β / γ = 3**, meaning each infectious person infects **three others on average** in a fully susceptible population.

---

### **💡 Applications**

* Predicting **epidemic peak and duration**
* Evaluating **vaccination strategies** (reducing S)
* Informing **public health interventions**

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Assumes **homogeneous mixing** (equal contact probability for all)
❌ Does not account for **incubation period** (addressed in SEIR model)
❌ No births, deaths, or migration included in basic model

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **SIR model** is fundamental for understanding **infectious disease dynamics**
✅ Defines **disease spread, peak, and total affected population**
✅ Forms the basis for **more complex epidemiological models**
