## **🧬 Heritability Estimation**

### **📖 Introduction**

**Heritability** quantifies how much of the variation in a trait within a population is due to **genetic differences among individuals**.

✅ It is crucial for understanding **genetic contribution to traits or diseases**.

---

### **🔍 What is Heritability?**

#### **1. Broad-Sense Heritability (H²)**

* Includes **all genetic variance** (additive, dominance, epistasis).

$$
H^2 = \frac{V_G}{V_P}
$$

Where:

* **V\_G:** Genetic variance
* **V\_P:** Total phenotypic variance

---

#### **2. Narrow-Sense Heritability (h²)**

* Includes only **additive genetic variance**.

$$
h^2 = \frac{V_A}{V_P}
$$

✅ Important for predicting **response to selection** (e.g. breeding programs).

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

✅ **Heritability ranges from 0 to 1** (0% to 100%).
✅ **High heritability** implies genetic differences explain most variation **in that specific population and environment**.

❌ Does not imply immutability or lack of environmental influence.

### **🔬 Practical Example: Parent-Offspring Regression**

#### **Scenario**

A study measures **height** in parents and offspring:

| **Parent Height (cm)** | **Offspring Height (cm)** |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 160                    | 165                       |
| 170                    | 168                       |
| 175                    | 172                       |
| 180                    | 176                       |
| 185                    | 180                       |
| 190                    | 182                       |

---

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Regress offspring height on parent height**

The **slope of regression line = heritability estimate (h²)** under certain assumptions (e.g. mid-parent value if both parents are used).

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **statsmodels for regression**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels pandas

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Parent': [160,170,175,180,185,190],
    'Offspring': [165,168,172,176,180,182]
})

# Add constant for intercept
X = sm.add_constant(data['Parent'])
y = data['Offspring']

# Regression model
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

# Print summary
print(model.summary())

# Extract slope as heritability estimate
heritability = model.params['Parent']
print(f"Estimated heritability (h²): {heritability:.2f}")
```

---

#### **Interpretation**

✅ **Slope (heritability estimate)** indicates **increase in offspring height per cm increase in parent height**.

For example, **h² = 0.5** suggests 50% of variation in height is explained by additive genetic factors.

---

### **💡 Twin Studies for Heritability**

Another approach involves **comparing trait similarity between monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins**:

$$
h^2 = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ})
$$

Where **r\_MZ** and **r\_DZ** are intraclass correlation coefficients for MZ and DZ twins respectively.

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Heritability is population-specific and environment-specific**
✅ High heritability does not imply **genetic determinism at individual level**

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Does not identify **specific genes involved**
❌ Can be inflated if **environmental similarity is higher among relatives**

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Heritability estimation quantifies genetic contribution** to trait variation
✅ Methods include **parent-offspring regression, twin studies, and SNP-based heritability**
✅ Essential for understanding **genetics of complex traits and designing genetic studies**
