# **üìö Introduction to Biostatistics Techniques**

In the fields of **medicine, public health, and biological research**, data analysis plays a crucial role in deriving meaningful conclusions that guide patient care, public health policies, and scientific understanding. While general statistical techniques such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analysis form the **foundation of data analysis**, **biostatistics extends these methods** to address the **unique characteristics of biological and health-related data**.

Biostatistics is not merely a subset of statistics; it is a specialized application that accounts for:

* **Time-to-event data (survival analysis)**
* **Disease frequencies and associations (epidemiological measures)**
* **Diagnostic test evaluation**
* **Complex data structures such as clustered or longitudinal data**

This tutorial series will guide you through **additional biostatistical techniques** that are **essential beyond general statistics**. You will learn about:

* Analysing survival and time-to-event outcomes
* Measuring risk and odds in clinical studies
* Evaluating diagnostic tests
* Synthesising research findings via meta-analysis
* Handling repeated and clustered observations
* Applying Bayesian methods in biostatistical contexts

By mastering these techniques, you will be equipped to **conduct robust analyses** in clinical trials, epidemiological studies, and biomedical research, enabling you to make **evidence-based decisions with confidence**.

That is an excellent and practical question. Here is a clear and structured overview.

## **üß¨ Course Content in Bio-Statistics**

While general statistics (mean, median, SD, t-tests, ANOVA, regression) form the foundation, **biostatistics** incorporates additional methods tailored for biological, clinical, and epidemiological data.

#### **I. Clinical and Epidemiological Techniques**

1. **Survival Analysis**

   * Kaplan-Meier estimator
   * Log-Rank test
   * Cox Proportional Hazards model

2. **Life Tables**

   * For actuarial survival analysis and mortality rates.

3. **Incidence and Prevalence Calculations**

   * Disease frequency measures.

4. **Relative Risk (RR) and Odds Ratio (OR)**

   * For comparing risks between groups in cohort and case-control studies.

5. **Hazard Ratios**

   * Interpreting survival models.

#### **II. Categorical Data Analysis**

6. **Chi-Square Test (including tests for trend)**

7. **Fisher‚Äôs Exact Test**

   * For small sample categorical data.

8. **McNemar‚Äôs Test**

   * For paired nominal data (e.g. pre-post studies).

9. **Logistic Regression**

   * Binary outcomes (e.g. disease/no disease).

10. **Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Regression**

* For multi-category outcomes.

### **üìù Summary**

While **general statistical techniques** remain essential, **biostatistics uniquely emphasises**:

* **Survival analysis** for time-to-event data
* **Risk/odds ratios** for epidemiological associations
* **Diagnostic test evaluation**
* **Meta-analysis** for evidence synthesis
* **Longitudinal mixed models** for repeated measures

Learning these will prepare you well for **clinical research, epidemiology, public health, and biomedical data analysis**.
