## **🧬 Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**

### **📖 Introduction**

While **sensitivity and specificity** measure **intrinsic properties of a test**, they do not tell us:

✅ What is the **chance that a person who tests positive actually has the disease**?
✅ What is the **chance that a person who tests negative truly does not have the disease**?

These are given by **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)** and **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**.

---

### **🔍 Definitions**

#### **1. Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**

> **Probability that a person with a positive test result truly has the disease.**

$$
PPV = \frac{True \ Positives}{True \ Positives + False \ Positives}
$$

✅ Influenced by **disease prevalence** in the tested population.

---

#### **2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**

> **Probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease.**

$$
NPV = \frac{True \ Negatives}{True \ Negatives + False \ Negatives}
$$

✅ Also influenced by **disease prevalence**.

### **📝 Key Concepts**

|            | **Disease +**       | **Disease –**       | **Total** |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| **Test +** | True Positive (TP)  | False Positive (FP) | TP + FP   |
| **Test –** | False Negative (FN) | True Negative (TN)  | FN + TN   |
| **Total**  | TP + FN             | FP + TN             | N         |

✅ **PPV** = TP / (TP + FP)
✅ **NPV** = TN / (TN + FN)

---

### **💡 Importance**

* **PPV:** Useful for **confirming disease** after a positive test result
* **NPV:** Useful for **excluding disease** after a negative test result

### **🔬 Practical Example**

Using the **previous dataset**:

|            | **Disease +** | **Disease –** | **Total** |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Test +** | 90            | 10            | 100       |
| **Test –** | 10            | 90            | 100       |
| **Total**  | 100           | 100           | 200       |

#### **Calculations**

1. **PPV**

$$
= \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
= \frac{90}{90 + 10}
= \frac{90}{100}
= 0.90 \text{ or } 90\%
$$

✅ *Among those testing positive, 90% actually have the disease.*

---

2. **NPV**

$$
= \frac{TN}{TN + FN}
= \frac{90}{90 + 10}
= \frac{90}{100}
= 0.90 \text{ or } 90\%
$$

✅ *Among those testing negative, 90% truly do not have the disease.*

---

### **💡 Effect of Disease Prevalence**

* **High prevalence:** PPV increases, NPV decreases
* **Low prevalence:** PPV decreases, NPV increases

This is why screening tests in **low prevalence populations** can yield many **false positives** despite high sensitivity and specificity.

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **simple calculations**:

```python
# Define values
TP = 90
FP = 10
FN = 10
TN = 90

# Calculate PPV and NPV
PPV = TP / (TP + FP)
NPV = TN / (TN + FN)

print(f"Positive Predictive Value (PPV): {PPV:.2%}")
print(f"Negative Predictive Value (NPV): {NPV:.2%}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **PPV:** Probability of disease given a **positive test result**
✅ **NPV:** Probability of no disease given a **negative test result**

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ PPV and NPV are **dependent on disease prevalence**, unlike sensitivity and specificity which are test properties.

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **PPV and NPV** provide practical information for **clinical decision-making**
✅ Both are **prevalence-dependent**
✅ Used alongside sensitivity and specificity for **complete test evaluation**
