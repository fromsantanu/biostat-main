## **🧬 Friedman Test**

### **📖 Introduction**

The **Friedman Test** is a non-parametric alternative to **repeated measures ANOVA**. It is used when:

✅ Comparing **more than two related groups or conditions**
✅ Data is **ordinal** or **continuous but not normally distributed**

---

### **🔍 When to Use**

✅ Measurements are taken from the **same subjects under different conditions or time points**

Examples:

* Pain scores measured at **baseline, week 2, and week 4** for the same patients.
* Effectiveness ratings of **three treatments by the same group of participants**.

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

1. **Ranks Within Subjects:**

* For each subject, rank the scores across conditions.

2. **Test Statistic (Q or χ²r):**

$$
Q = \frac{12}{nk(k+1)} \sum R_j^2 - 3n(k+1)
$$

Where:

* **n:** Number of subjects
* **k:** Number of conditions
* **R\_j:** Sum of ranks for condition j

✅ Q approximately follows **Chi-square distribution** with **(k – 1) degrees of freedom**.

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A researcher measures **pain scores (0–10)** of **5 patients** at **three time points**:

| **Patient** | **Baseline** | **Week 2** | **Week 4** |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 7            | 5          | 3          |
| 2           | 6            | 4          | 4          |
| 3           | 8            | 6          | 5          |
| 4           | 5            | 4          | 3          |
| 5           | 7            | 5          | 4          |

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Rank within each patient**

| Patient | Baseline | Week 2 | Week 4 |
| ------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1       | 3        | 2      | 1      |
| 2       | 3        | 1.5    | 1.5    |
| 3       | 3        | 2      | 1      |
| 4       | 3        | 2      | 1      |
| 5       | 3        | 2      | 1      |

---

2. **Calculate sum of ranks for each time point**

| Time Point | Sum of Ranks                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Baseline   | 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = **15**    |
| Week 2     | 2 + 1.5 + 2 + 2 + 2 = **9.5** |
| Week 4     | 1 + 1.5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **5.5** |

---

3. **Apply formula**

$$
n = 5, k = 3
$$

$$
Q = \frac{12}{5 \times 3(3+1)} (15^2 + 9.5^2 + 5.5^2) - 3 \times 5 \times (3+1)
$$

Calculate:

* Denominator = 5 x 12 = 60
* Multiply:

$$
15^2 + 9.5^2 + 5.5^2 = 225 + 90.25 + 30.25 = 345.5
$$

So:

$$
Q = \frac{12 \times 345.5}{60} - 60
$$

$$
Q = \frac{4146}{60} - 60
$$

$$
Q = 69.1 - 60
$$

$$
Q = 9.1
$$

---

4. **Determine p-value**

Degrees of freedom = **k – 1 = 2**

Using Chi-square table:

* Critical value at α=0.05 = **5.99**

✅ Since **Q = 9.1 > 5.99**, result is **significant**.

---

### **💡 Conclusion**

✅ **Pain scores differ significantly across time points**.

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **scipy.stats module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install scipy

import scipy.stats as stats

# Data
baseline = [7,6,8,5,7]
week2 = [5,4,6,4,5]
week4 = [3,4,5,3,4]

# Perform Friedman Test
statistic, p_value = stats.friedmanchisquare(baseline, week2, week4)

print(f"Friedman statistic: {statistic:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **p-value < 0.05:** Significant differences among the three time points.

---

### **💡 Limitations**

❌ Does not indicate **which specific groups differ**; post-hoc tests are needed
❌ Less powerful than repeated measures ANOVA if data is normal

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Friedman Test** compares **more than two related non-normal groups**
✅ Uses **ranks within subjects**
✅ Essential for **repeated measures studies with ordinal or skewed data**
