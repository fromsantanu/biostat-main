## **🧬 Fisher’s Exact Test**

### **📖 Introduction**

In categorical data analysis, when dealing with **small sample sizes** or **low expected frequencies** in contingency tables, the Chi-Square test’s assumptions are violated. In such cases, **Fisher’s Exact Test** is the preferred method.

---

### **🔍 What is Fisher’s Exact Test?**

**Fisher’s Exact Test** is a **non-parametric statistical test** used to determine if there is a **non-random association** between two categorical variables in a **2x2 contingency table**, especially when:

✅ **Sample sizes are small**
✅ **Expected frequencies** in any cell are < 5

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

* Calculates **exact probability** of observing the data (or more extreme) under **null hypothesis of independence**.
* Does not rely on large-sample approximations (unlike Chi-square test).

---

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ 2x2 tables with **small samples**
✅ **Any table** where Chi-square assumptions are not met
✅ Analysing clinical trial or case-control data with small counts

### **🔬 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A small clinical trial tests a new drug for infection clearance:

|             | **Cleared Infection** | **Not Cleared** | **Total** |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| **Drug**    | 8                     | 2               | 10        |
| **Placebo** | 2                     | 8               | 10        |
| **Total**   | 10                    | 10              | 20        |

---

#### **Hypotheses**

* **Null hypothesis:** No association between treatment and outcome
* **Alternative hypothesis:** There is an association

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **scipy.stats** library:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import fisher_exact

# Create contingency table
table = np.array([[8, 2],
                  [2, 8]])

# Perform Fisher's Exact Test
oddsratio, p_value = fisher_exact(table)

print(f"Odds Ratio: {oddsratio:.2f}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **p-value < 0.05:** Significant association between drug treatment and infection clearance
✅ **Odds Ratio > 1:** Suggests beneficial effect of the drug compared to placebo

---

### **💡 Two-tailed vs One-tailed Test**

* **Default (two-tailed):** Tests for any difference in proportions
* **One-tailed test:** Can be specified if hypothesis is directional (e.g. drug is **better**, not just different)

---

### **🔬 Manual Calculation (Conceptual)**

The probability of observing the table (given marginal totals) is calculated using **hypergeometric distribution**:

$$
P = \frac{{a+b \choose a}{c+d \choose c}}{{n \choose a+c}}
$$

Where:

* $a, b, c, d$ are cell counts
* $n$ is total sample size

Due to complexity, calculations are usually done via statistical software.

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Fisher’s Exact Test** is ideal for **small sample categorical data**
✅ Provides **exact p-values** without relying on large sample approximations
✅ Widely used in **clinical trials, case-control studies, and rare event analyses**
