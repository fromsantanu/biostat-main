## **🧬 Forest Plots**

### **📖 Introduction**

When conducting a meta-analysis, visualising the results is crucial for:

✅ Showing individual study estimates and confidence intervals
✅ Displaying the **pooled effect** and its confidence interval
✅ Assessing **consistency and heterogeneity**

This is done using a **Forest Plot**.

---

### **🔍 What is a Forest Plot?**

A **Forest Plot** is a graphical representation of the results of individual studies included in a meta-analysis, along with the **overall pooled estimate**.

✅ Each study is shown with its **effect estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI)**
✅ The **size of the box** represents the **weight of the study**
✅ The **pooled estimate** is displayed as a **diamond**

---

### **📝 Key Components**

1. **Study Names:** Listed on the left.
2. **Effect Sizes and CI:** Shown as boxes (point estimate) with horizontal lines (CI).
3. **Weights:** Often reflected by box sizes.
4. **Pooled Estimate:** Diamond at the bottom showing overall effect.
5. **Vertical Line of No Effect:** Reference line (e.g. RR=1 for risk ratios, MD=0 for mean differences).

### **💡 When to Use**

✅ Presenting results of **meta-analysis**
✅ Comparing **individual study results with pooled estimate**
✅ Communicating findings in **systematic reviews, clinical guidelines, and presentations**

### **🔬 Practical Example**

Using the **previous risk ratio dataset**:

| **Study** | **RR** | **SE** |
| --------- | ------ | ------ |
| 1         | 0.80   | 0.10   |
| 2         | 0.85   | 0.12   |
| 3         | 0.78   | 0.15   |
| 4         | 0.82   | 0.09   |
| 5         | 0.88   | 0.11   |

---

### **🖥️ Implementation in Python**

Using **matplotlib** for a simple forest plot:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'study': ['Study 1','Study 2','Study 3','Study 4','Study 5'],
    'RR': [0.80,0.85,0.78,0.82,0.88],
    'SE': [0.10,0.12,0.15,0.09,0.11]
})

# Calculate 95% CI
data['lower'] = data['RR'] - 1.96 * data['SE']
data['upper'] = data['RR'] + 1.96 * data['SE']

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(6,4))
y_pos = np.arange(len(data))
plt.errorbar(data['RR'], y_pos, xerr=1.96*data['SE'], fmt='o', color='black', ecolor='grey', capsize=3)

# Reference line (no effect)
plt.axvline(x=1, color='red', linestyle='--')

# Labels
plt.yticks(y_pos, data['study'])
plt.xlabel('Risk Ratio (RR)')
plt.title('Forest Plot of Risk Ratios')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ Each point shows **study RR and CI**
✅ The **red vertical line at RR=1** indicates no effect
✅ Studies whose CI do not cross RR=1 are **statistically significant** individually

---

### **💡 Advanced Forest Plots**

For professional meta-analysis plots:

* Use **meta-analysis packages in R (e.g. `meta`, `metafor`)** for pooled estimate diamonds and heterogeneity statistics
* Python libraries like **`meta-analysis` modules in `statsmodels`** or `plotnine` (ggplot-like) for enhanced visuals

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **Forest Plots** are essential for presenting **meta-analysis results** clearly
✅ Show **individual study effects, confidence intervals, and pooled estimates**
✅ Facilitate assessment of **effect sizes, consistency, and study weights**
