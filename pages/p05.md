## **🧬 Diagnostic Test Evaluation – Introduction**

### **📖 Overview**

In clinical practice and research, evaluating the **accuracy and utility of diagnostic tests** is critical for:

✅ Correctly identifying disease
✅ Avoiding false positives or negatives
✅ Guiding treatment decisions and public health screening strategies

**Diagnostic Test Evaluation** provides statistical techniques to measure a test’s performance.

---

### **🔍 What is Diagnostic Test Evaluation?**

It involves analysing how well a test:

✅ Identifies **disease when it is present (sensitivity)**
✅ Excludes **disease when it is absent (specificity)**
✅ Performs in **real-world populations** (predictive values)

---

### **📝 Why is it Important?**

✅ Informs **clinical decision making**
✅ Assesses **trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity**
✅ Evaluates overall **test accuracy (ROC and AUC)**

For example:

* High **sensitivity** is crucial for **screening tests** to catch all potential cases
* High **specificity** is vital for **confirmatory tests** to avoid unnecessary treatments

### **📑 What You Will Learn in This Section**

This chapter introduces **key techniques for diagnostic test evaluation**, including:

1. **Sensitivity and Specificity**
2. **Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**
3. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves**
4. **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**

---

### **💡 Applications**

✅ Evaluating **new diagnostic tests** against gold standards
✅ Assessing **screening tests in public health**
✅ Comparing **different diagnostic methods**

---

### **🎯 Learning Objectives**

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

✅ Calculate and interpret **sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV**
✅ Understand and create **ROC curves**
✅ Calculate **AUC** to assess overall test accuracy
✅ Implement these analyses using **Python or R**
