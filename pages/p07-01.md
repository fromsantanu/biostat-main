## **üß¨ Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test**

### **üìñ Introduction**

The **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** is a non-parametric alternative to the **paired t-test**. It is used when:

‚úÖ Data is **paired (matched samples or repeated measures)**
‚úÖ **Differences between pairs are not normally distributed**

---

### **üîç When to Use**

‚úÖ Comparing **median differences** between two related groups
‚úÖ Data is **ordinal** or **continuous but non-normal**

Example: Comparing **pre-treatment and post-treatment pain scores** in the same patients.

---

### **üìù Key Concepts**

1. **Ranks of Differences:**

* Calculate differences between paired observations
* Rank the **absolute differences** (ignoring sign)

2. **Sum of Positive and Negative Ranks:**

* Assign original signs to ranks
* Calculate sums of positive ranks (W‚Å∫) and negative ranks (W‚Åª)

3. **Test Statistic (W):**

* The **smaller** of W‚Å∫ and W‚Åª is used as the test statistic.

### **üî¨ Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

A researcher measures **pain scores (0‚Äì10 scale)** before and after a new analgesic in **8 patients**:

| **Patient** | **Pre-treatment** | **Post-treatment** |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1           | 8                 | 5                  |
| 2           | 7                 | 4                  |
| 3           | 6                 | 4                  |
| 4           | 9                 | 6                  |
| 5           | 5                 | 5                  |
| 6           | 7                 | 3                  |
| 7           | 8                 | 5                  |
| 8           | 6                 | 4                  |

---

#### **Stepwise Calculation**

1. **Calculate differences (Post ‚Äì Pre)**

| Patient | Difference |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 1       | -3         |
| 2       | -3         |
| 3       | -2         |
| 4       | -3         |
| 5       | 0          |
| 6       | -4         |
| 7       | -3         |
| 8       | -2         |

*(Exclude zero differences for ranking.)*

---

2. **Rank absolute differences**

| Difference | Absolute | Rank |
| ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| -2         | 2        | 1.5  |
| -2         | 2        | 1.5  |
| -3         | 3        | 4.5  |
| -3         | 3        | 4.5  |
| -3         | 3        | 4.5  |
| -3         | 3        | 4.5  |
| -4         | 4        | 7    |

*(Average ranks used for ties.)*

---

3. **Assign signs to ranks**

All differences are negative:

| Difference | Rank (signed) |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| -2         | -1.5          |
| -2         | -1.5          |
| -3         | -4.5          |
| -3         | -4.5          |
| -3         | -4.5          |
| -3         | -4.5          |
| -4         | -7            |

---

4. **Calculate sum of positive and negative ranks**

* W‚Å∫ = 0
* W‚Åª = sum of absolute ranks = 28

---

5. **Test Statistic (W):**

‚úÖ W = **smaller of W‚Å∫ and W‚Åª = 0**

---

6. **Interpretation**

Using Wilcoxon critical value table for **n=7 (non-zero differences)** and Œ±=0.05 (two-tailed):

* Critical value = 2

‚úÖ Since **W (0) < 2**, result is **significant**.

---

### **üí° Conclusion**

‚úÖ **Post-treatment pain scores are significantly lower** than pre-treatment scores (p < 0.05).

---

### **üñ•Ô∏è Implementation in Python**

Using **scipy.stats module**:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install scipy

import scipy.stats as stats

# Data
pre = [8,7,6,9,5,7,8,6]
post = [5,4,4,6,5,3,5,4]

# Perform Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
statistic, p_value = stats.wilcoxon(pre, post)

print(f"Wilcoxon statistic: {statistic}")
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.4f}")
```

---

### **üîë Interpretation**

‚úÖ **p-value < 0.05:** Significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores.

---

### **üí° Limitations**

‚ùå Does not provide **mean difference**
‚ùå Less powerful than paired t-test if data is normally distributed

---

### **üéØ Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test** compares **paired non-normal data**
‚úÖ Tests for **median differences between two related groups**
‚úÖ Widely used for **clinical trials with pre-post measurements**
