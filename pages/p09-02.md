## **🧬 Introduction to Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)**

### **📖 Introduction**

**Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)** are powerful tools in genetic epidemiology to:

✅ Identify **genetic variants (SNPs)** associated with diseases or traits
✅ Understand the **genetic architecture** of complex diseases
✅ Inform **precision medicine and drug discovery**

---

### **🔍 What is GWAS?**

A **GWAS** scans the entire genome, testing **hundreds of thousands to millions of SNPs** for association with a phenotype (e.g. diabetes, height, blood pressure).

✅ It is an **observational study design** using population data.

---

### **📝 Key Concepts**

#### **1. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)**

✅ A variation at a single base pair in DNA (e.g. A/T)

---

#### **2. Case-Control GWAS**

* **Cases:** Individuals with disease
* **Controls:** Individuals without disease

Test for **allele frequency differences** between cases and controls for each SNP.

---

#### **3. Multiple Testing Correction**

✅ Testing millions of SNPs increases **Type I error (false positives)**

**Bonferroni correction** is often applied:

$$
α_{corrected} = \frac{0.05}{1,000,000} = 5 \times 10^{-8}
$$

*(Genome-wide significance threshold)*

### **🔬 Workflow of GWAS**

1. **Sample Collection**

   * Phenotype measurement
   * DNA extraction

2. **Genotyping**

   * Using SNP arrays (e.g. Illumina, Affymetrix)

3. **Quality Control**

   * Remove SNPs/individuals with high missingness
   * Check for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium
   * Remove related individuals to avoid confounding

4. **Association Testing**

   * Logistic regression for binary traits
   * Linear regression for quantitative traits

5. **Multiple Testing Correction**

   * Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate (FDR)

6. **Replication**

   * Significant findings are replicated in **independent datasets**

7. **Biological Interpretation**

   * Functional annotation, pathway analysis

---

### **💡 Practical Example**

#### **Scenario**

In a GWAS of **Type 2 Diabetes**, SNP rs12345 has:

* **Minor allele frequency (MAF):** 0.30 in cases, 0.25 in controls
* **p-value:** 1 x 10^-6

✅ Is it genome-wide significant?

---

#### **Interpretation**

* **Threshold for genome-wide significance = 5 x 10^-8**

✅ **p-value (1x10^-6) > 5x10^-8**

Thus, **not genome-wide significant**, but may be **suggestive** and worth replication.

### **🖥️ Simplified Implementation Example in Python**

While full GWAS requires **specialised software (PLINK, SNPTEST)**, here is a **basic logistic regression example** for one SNP:

```python
# Install if not installed
# pip install statsmodels pandas

import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Example dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'SNP_rs12345': [0,1,2,0,1,2,1,0,2,1],  # genotype coded as 0,1,2
    'Phenotype': [0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1]     # 0=control, 1=case
})

# Add intercept
data['intercept'] = 1

# Logistic regression
logit = sm.Logit(data['Phenotype'], data[['intercept','SNP_rs12345']])
result = logit.fit(disp=0)

# Summary
print(result.summary())
```

---

### **🔑 Interpretation**

✅ **Coefficient for SNP\_rs12345** indicates **log-odds increase per allele**
✅ **p-value** tests association significance

---

### **💡 Limitations of GWAS**

❌ Requires **large sample sizes** to detect small effect sizes
❌ Identifies **association, not causation**
❌ Many variants lie in **non-coding regions**, requiring functional studies

---

### **💡 Advancements Beyond GWAS**

✅ **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS):** Aggregate effects of multiple SNPs
✅ **Fine-mapping:** Identifies causal variants in associated regions
✅ **Mendelian Randomisation:** Infers causality using genetic variants as instruments

---

### **🎯 Key Takeaways**

✅ **GWAS identifies genetic variants associated with diseases or traits**
✅ Requires **rigorous multiple testing correction and replication**
✅ Forms the basis for **precision medicine, genetic risk prediction, and biological insights**
